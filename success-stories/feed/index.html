<h2><strong>Simply Wanting More</strong></h2>



<p>In 2018, it became clear to Grafical that they were missing out on a lot of potential customers and leads. They knew that they could do better, and therefore, they started looking for a tool that could help decrease their bounce rate and increase their lead generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their search they came across Sleeknote and have since used the software to develop several campaigns for their website that have helped them achieve just what they were hoping for. Since beginning to use Sleeknote they have seen conversion rates of over 20 percent. This is not the average conversion rate, of course, but it shows just how impressive results they have seen by using Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Seeing the Results They Were Hoping For</strong></h2>



<p>Grafical has multiple active campaigns with Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy they use is to give out a small discount voucher to those that sign up for their newsletter. One campaign can be found on their landing page, where a small teaser appears in the bottom left corner:&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="603" height="112" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28.png" alt="Grafical SS 5" class="wp-image-114667" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28.png 603w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-300x56.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-380x71.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-600x111.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-180x33.png 180w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-250x46.png 250w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-220x41.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-385x72.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></figure></div>



<p>This unfolds to a more elaborate pop-up that informs the visitor that all they need to do is sign up for the newsletter and then they will receive a 10% discount.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="652" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-1024x652.png" alt="Grafical SS 1" class="wp-image-114651" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-1024x652.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-300x191.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-768x489.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-380x242.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-600x382.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-760x484.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-55x35.png 55w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-78x50.png 78w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-740x471.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-220x140.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-385x245.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48.png 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It can be just that simple. This campaign generates approximately 1,200 new leads for Grafical, every month!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another campaign they have had great success with, and continue to have great success with, is their exit-intent pop-up. One of the problems they were experiencing before Sleeknote was their bounce rate. With the use of Sleeknote they have made this campaign:&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="827" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-1024x827.png" alt="Grafical SS 4" class="wp-image-114663" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-1024x827.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-300x242.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-768x620.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-380x307.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-600x484.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-760x614.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-43x35.png 43w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-62x50.png 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-607x490.png 607w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-220x178.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-385x311.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This campaign generates more than 300 fresh leads every month, and even though it doesn’t ensure that the visitor completes their purchase, it does enable Grafical to contact them afterwards.&nbsp;These were customers that were about to leave the site!</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Continuous Success Made Easy</strong></h2>



<p>There are several reasons why Grafical have continued to use Sleeknote but the main reason is the ease and the automation of a software that continues to provide good results. As Benjamin, the marketing and web assistant at Grafical put it when describing how they use Sleeknote right now:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“This might sound negative, it’s definitely not supposed to, but everything just runs automatically and takes care of itself.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grafical’s campaigns continue to be successful and therefore, there is no need for new campaigns or to constantly monitor or alter them. The campaigns generate hundreds of new leads every month, and it is the main reason why Grafical is so happy with their use of Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also some other reasons why they have not looked for another option:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sleeknote is Easy.</strong> The employees at Grafical think that Sleeknote is simple and easy to use, and it enables them to be creative in their own way.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The Employees are Helpful.</strong> Whenever there is a problem or something that they do not know the help is only a mere call or chat away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Available Numbers.</strong> The analytics feature of Sleeknote makes it so easy to keep track of how well the campaigns are doing, and also stay on top of the leads that have been generated.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Embracing Events With Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<p>One way that Grafical&nbsp; has yet to take advantage of Sleeknote is to prepare for the major sales holidays and events that happen throughout the year. This is something that they aim to improve in the future by getting help from Sleeknote to get ready for Black Friday, January sales and other large events that they still have to make easier for themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be used for any kind of holiday or event. In many occasions it is just about gaining the attention of the consumer, and making them aware of what you can do for them. Like this Sleekbar, where Grafical informs their visitors about their assortment of hand sanitiser and masks in this time of Covid-19:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Stealing the Customers back from the OTA’s&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is converting website visitors into customers. In the hotel industry, this is especially difficult due to online travel agents (OTAs) that are partners but also, in a way, competitors. Many customers book through OTAs because they present and compare all hotels on price and quality, so the visitors feel they are making an informed decision. Hotels seek to avoid using OTAs and sell directly to the visitors instead so they don’t have to pay up to 25 percent in commission per booking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martijn, the digital marketing coordinator of Sircle Collection, said that he could see that their website had many visitors, but not nearly as many bookings. To help optimize the hotels’ conversion rate, he created a strategy based on using website popups.</p>



<p>He decided to combine popups with persuasion marketing, which enabled him to reach each visitor at the right place, at the right time and offer the right benefit. The popup strategy that Martijn created using Sleeknote consisted of 350+ different popups across all the domains of Sircle Collection.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Why Sircle Collection Chose Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Sleeknote was not the first popup tool that Sircle Collection worked with. Martijn said that they had worked with two other options previously but a combination of the price and ease of using the tool, led Sircle Collection to try Sleeknote, and they have now been using it since the rebranding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An additional factor for Martijn in choosing Sleeknote was that the process of branding was made easy through the tool. This was particularly important due to the rebranding of the company.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Improving the Conversion Rate Using Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Sircle Collection used Sleeknote to create a range of different popups that were to guide the visitor or offer some kind of benefit. The first way they did this was to create a small teaser that would appear on any site to offer each visitor more information about booking through the hotel’s website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When clicked, the user then saw a popup sharing the benefits of booking through the hotel’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="613" height="975" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20.png" alt="Sircle Collections Case Study 3" class="wp-image-111947" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20.png 613w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-189x300.png 189w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-380x604.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-600x954.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-22x35.png 22w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-31x50.png 31w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-308x490.png 308w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-220x350.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-385x612.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></figure></div>



<p>Sircle Collection also created an <a href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exit-intent popup</a> that appeared when a visitor had been through certain steps in the booking agent was about to leave. When working with an OTA there is a cost agreement, which means that Sircle Collection is unable to lower the cost of their hotel rooms. They can, however, offer a discount to the visitor, which is what they tried. </p>



<p>Martijn said that this is a win-win for the company and the customer because it makes the room cheaper and most importantly the discount is smaller than the commission of an OTA.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="773" height="923" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19.png" alt="Sircle Collections Case Study 2" class="wp-image-111943" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19.png 773w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-251x300.png 251w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-768x917.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-380x454.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-600x716.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-760x907.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-29x35.png 29w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-42x50.png 42w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-410x490.png 410w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-220x263.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-385x460.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></figure></div>



<p>The exit-intent popups offer a promotional code, which makes them measurable because it is registered every time they are used. Sircle Collection has implemented thirteen of these campaigns that have had an average conversion rate of almost <strong>14 percent, </strong>and these are visitors who were about to leave the site. </p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The initial plan for Sircle Collection was to just use Sleeknote to improve the conversion rate, however, Martijn didn’t just stop there. He has successfully used Sleeknote to create awareness about their CSR work, where they have been selling art and donating all the profits to medicines sans frontier (doctors without borders). </p>

<p>Martijn said that this use of Sleeknote was unexpected but a pleasant surprise. Therefore, he has been considering what else he could be doing and is now planning a future project where Sircle Collection will be <a href="https://sleeknote.com/collect-email-addresses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collecting emails</a> and building an email list with the use of Sleeknote.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>ProfitMetrics faced a lot of the same challenges as many other B2B businesses. They wanted to collect more leads—and convert those leads into customers—but didn’t have the time or resources to do so.</p>



<p>ProfitMetrics knew how important email marketing is, but lacked the time to properly map out email flows and figure out where to start. Frederik has been in the online industry for many years and was already collecting a lot of leads, but he wanted Sleeknote to give his lead generation a boost.&nbsp;</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f6350d419de8" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;The game-changer for me was the many years of experience Sleeknote has with popups, lead generation, and email marketing.&#8221;    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">
            <span class="customer-name">Frederik Boysen</span>
            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>For Frederik, it was important that he knew the people who would be doing the work for him. He had already seen the work of both Sleeknotes CMO, Emil Kristensen, and their Head of Email Marketing, Rikke Thomsen. He knew that they had the skills to implement a solid email marketing strategy, which was exactly what ProfitMetrics needed.</p>

<h2>The Collaboration</h2>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f63510c19de9" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;The whole process was very smooth and was customized to fit my schedule and my terms. I was briefed along the way on the progress, which gave me peace of mind to know that everything was taken care of.&#8221;

    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">

            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Whenever we needed Frederik to approve or give feedback on our initiatives, we just sent him an email or scheduled a quick call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frederik had some reservations about the price of our services to begin with but knew that the investment would pay off. In Frederik’s own words: </p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;Sleeknote provides the skills and knowledge that I don’t have. A huge benefit for me is the many years of experience Sleeknote has with lead generation and email marketing.&#8221;

    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">

            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Plus, ProfitMetrics is a SaaS company just like Sleeknote, which reassured Frederik that we could understand his business and its audience.</p>



<p>Frederik wanted to get a solid foundation for his email marketing, and most important of all, he wanted to automate the process to free up more time for him to do what he does best. With that in mind, we set up two automated email workflows for ProfitMetrics. One to welcome new subscribers and educate them about ROAS and ad spending, and one to help users get the most out of their free ProfitMetrics trial—and turn more free trials into paying customers.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How ProfitMetrics Collects Valuable Feedback</h2>



<p>One of the first SleekBoxes we implemented on ProfitMetics.io was an Exit-Intent SleekBox that collects feedback from visitors leaving the site. The SleekBox asks why people visited the site, and what they expected ProfitMetrics might be able to help them with. This gives Frederik some good insights he can use to add small tweaks and optimize the site.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Design Process</h2>



<p>Having Sleeknote design the popups for him was also one of the reasons why Frederik chose Sleeknote.</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f63516c19deb" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;I could easily pay a designer to design the popups for me, but that would be unnecessary money spent when Sleeknote knows what works and what doesn’t when it comes to popups.&#8221;    </blockquote>

<h2>Best Performing Campaign</h2>



<p>ProfitMetrics has a lot of success with its “Test din ROAS” campaign.</p>

<p>This SleekBox promotes a ROAS calculator and has a conversation rate of 4.86%. Frederik wanted to make it easy for site visitors to calculate their ROAS and see if their paid ads are generating actual profit. Once a visitor has calculated their ROAS, they get the results by email, giving Frederik and ProfitMetrics a really good sales lead. Frederik was also surprised to know that most of his visitors come from desktop because his understanding was that most customers start their journey on mobile.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Results</h2>



<p>Frederik also wanted to get more demo bookings. We implemented a demo booking popup on the site where visitors can book a demo with Frederik personally. The results so far have been very promising with a conversion rate of 10%.</p>



<p>They recently created an A/B test to see if a top bar&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;an eBook offer would outperform their slide-in&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;the eBook offer.</p>



<p>This is the top bar:</p>

<p>Knowing that you need to provide value to get people to sign up for a newsletter, Frederik came up with the idea of offering a valuable resource in exchange for an email address (the resource is called “How to increase your bottom line by 242% without increasing your marketing spend”). We set up a lead generation SleekBox with this offer, which as of writing, has a conversion rate of 3.25%.</p>

<h2>Increasing Transactions with Managed Solution</h2>



<p>Back in March 2019, Kings &amp; Queens started working with Sleeknote Managed Solution and ViaBill (an installment plan payment option). The goal was to promote the option to pay with ViaBill and increase the number of ViaBill transactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/managed-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sleeknote Managed Solution</a> is the newest in-house Sleeknote service, where conversion optimization experts manage your Sleeknote account with the purpose of generating more leads, boosting sales, and providing a better user experience on the customer’s site.</p>



<p>After three months, Kings &amp; Queens’ results speak for themselves:</p>



<ul><li>The number of ViaBill transactions has <strong>increased by 69.68% </strong>(subject to seasonal fluctuations)</li><li>The conversion rate for e-commerce on selected offers and campaigns has <strong>increased by 522.52%</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li>They’ve <strong>collected more than 8,000 newsletter subscribers.</strong></li></ul>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Promoting the New Payment Option</h2>



<p>To promote the option to pay with ViaBill, the Managed Solution team set up a campaign to create awareness around the alternative payment option.</p>



<p>The campaign promotes the advantages of choosing ViaBill as a payment option.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="308" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg" alt="Promoting the New Payment Option Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95529" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-300x243.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-43x35.jpg 43w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-62x50.jpg 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-220x178.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Boosting Sales with Category-Specific Campaigns</h2>



<p>The Managed Solution team set up several different campaigns on the Kings &amp; Queens website to promote relevant offers (e.g. two t-shirts for 200 DKK).</p>



<p>With Sleeknote, it’s possible to trigger the campaigns on specific URLs and for specific site visitors.</p>



<p>“We’ve struggled with promoting the offers we’ve had on the site–especially the ones where you can buy two or three t-shirts and get a discount.” says e-commerce manager, Ronni Andersen. “But because Sleeknote is so flexible, we can have specific campaigns with our Tommy Hilfiger t-shirts on our Tommy Hilfiger category page.”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="372" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3.jpg" alt="Boosting Sales with Category-Specific Campaigns Sleekbox 3" class="wp-image-95517" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-300x186.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-380x236.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-56x35.jpg 56w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-81x50.jpg 81w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-220x136.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-385x239.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>With a campaign promoting offers on relevant products, Kings &amp; Queens are able to give their visitors the feeling of being guided to better purchase decisions–just like they would in a physical store.</p>



<p>And these campaigns have paid off.</p>



<p>Their campaign promoting two t-shirts for DKK 200, has <strong>increased their conversion rate by 522%.</strong></p>



<p>That means 10% of visitors that clicked the campaign made a purchase. And out of the visitors who saw the campaign but didn’t click through, 1.61% converted into customers in the same period.</p>

<h2>A Flexible Tool for Mid-Season Sale</h2>



<p>From May 1st, 2019 to May 15th, 2019, Kings &amp; Queens had a mid-season sale. During this time, Ronni was happy to have Sleeknote as a tool and the Managed Solution team for assistance.</p>



<p>“It made a lot of sense for us to have Sleeknote during our mid-season sale where we had four different campaigns running,” says Ronni. “One [campaign] without a countdown timer at the beginning of the sale, and one at the end of the sale to increase urgency. These two campaigns were created for both desktop and mobile individually.” But that’s not even the best part.</p>



<p>“I was on vacation at the time of the sale. But with the advanced scheduling option and Managed Solution’s help, I was able to let go of the reins, knowing everything would be on track and run smoothly.”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="230" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2.jpg" alt="A Flexible Tool for Mid-Season Sale Sleekbox 2" class="wp-image-95509" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-380x146.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-91x35.jpg 91w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-130x50.jpg 130w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-220x84.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-385x148.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The campaign with a countdown timer <strong>increased conversions by 215.09%</strong> and the campaign without the countdown timer saw <strong>an increase of 216.98%</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A More Effective Way to Collect Leads</h2>



<p>With 19 physical stores, it’s been difficult for Kings &amp; Queens to control their newsletter signups from their KingsQueens.dk’ headquarters.</p>



<p>Ronni explains: “Before we started using Sleeknote, we only collected leads in our physical stores and they weren’t coming in consistently. With the new Sleeknote campaign on our site, we know that every visitor is presented with the opportunity to sign up. This is much more effective than being dependent on the sales assistants in the stores who don’t always remember to ask.”</p>

<h2>An Obvious Cooperation</h2>

<h2>The Value of Email Marketing</h2>



<p>When it comes to online marketing, your email list is one of your most valuable resources. In fact, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Email-Continues-Deliver-Strong-ROI-Value-Marketers/1014461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one study</a> found that emails are the most cost efficient online marketing channel, having an average ROI of 122%.</p>



<p>Horze’ marketing strategy is focused on many channels but one of the biggest is their email contacts. Recently, the marketing team invested in a new ESP system and lead generation is crucial in order to reach their KPI goals and succeed.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Horze Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Soon after using Sleeknote, Horze on-page conversion rate went from 2% to 5%. This alone would have been a satisfying achievement, but they decided to push forward and see how high the conversion could get. To do this, they explored the A/B testing feature and saw an increase in the on-page conversion rate from 6.7% to 26.9%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Horze Grew Their Email List Using Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Horze used Sleeknote to get qualified leads for their newsletter. The first way they did this was by offering discounts to new visitors.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="600" height="342" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95500" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-300x171.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-380x217.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-61x35.png 61w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-88x50.png 88w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-220x125.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-9-385x219.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>They also created competitions and split test different prizes to determine which were most likely to convince visitors to subscribe to their newsletter.</p>



<p>A perfect example of this is the A/B test for offering a winter turnout blanket versus a gift card, which showed that using the gift card as a prize increased the conversion rate by 298%.</p>

<h2>Big Brother</h2>



<p>Boozt.com has built a well-known brand in the Nordic countries over the last nine years, as a premium store. Three years ago, they started expanding into the mid-range price segment through a new outlet, Booztlet.com.</p>



<p>Over these three years, Booztlet’s massive growth has taken the company by storm. In fact, their current predictions place Booztlet as a growth driver for the entire company, over the next three-to-five years. This makes maintaining and accelerating growth a top priority for Kim Vile, Boozt’s E-Commerce Director.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Growing Pains</h2>



<p>As a new company, establishing a fast pace of growth is natural, but maintaining it throughout the years is the real challenge. The common view of growth identifies two key processes: acquiring new customers and retaining old ones.</p>



<p>Booztlet tackles the mid-range price segment, so a big part of their sales revolve around special offers, discounts, and deals. At first, they ran weekly campaigns on their site, including special deals and discounts that all of their visitors had access to. While they had a positive impact on sales, these campaigns did little in terms of customer retention. To use them to their full potential, Kim Vile turned them into incentives for signing up to the company’s newsletter, by making them exclusive to subscribers. In doing so, he created a “low-key loyalty membership.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Booztlet Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet uses their newsletter to create desire and interest through new collections and special deals sent to subscribers, as well as improving their on-site experience through direct access to their weekly campaigns. As of writing, it accounts for half of the company’s sales, making it a crucial part of their marketing strategy. The strategy for the newsletter is even more ambitious in the long run, aiming to introduce more personalized campaigns and on-site interactions for subscribers down the line. In either case, it plays—and will continue to play—a major role in Booztlet’s marketing strategy in the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In order to increase newsletter signups, Kim looked for ways to engage visitors on-site and make opting in simple. “I’m using Sleeknote for its rules,” Kim told me. “It’s just so easy to set when, where and how often to show your campaigns. Without any technical knowledge, you can set up a campaign within five minutes.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Booztlet Used Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet turned their weekly campaigns into incentives for signing up to their newsletter, by making the best deals and discounts exclusive to subscribers. They did this in two ways: by sending them newsletters about the latest offers, as well as using cookies on-site to differentiate between new visitors and subscribers. In doing so, subscribers were given access to the discounts immediately, while new visitors were shown the SleekBox below.</p>

<p>This simple concept proved to be extremely effective, generating leads for Booztlet’s newsletter on their international site, as well as their specific Danish, Finnish and Swedish sites.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they used Sleeknote’s cookie tracking capabilities to show on-site messages and offers only to their newsletter subscribers. One example is the SleekBar below they used to showcase a “Get 4, Pay only for 3” exclusive deal to visitors holding the “subscriber” cookie.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>By tweaking a system Booztlet already had in place, namely their weekly campaigns, and turning it into a signup incentive, they were able to not only increase sales but keep their existing customers interested and coming back for new deals and discounts.</p>



<p>Boozlet’s position as a growth driver for a company as massive as Boozt proves how far leveraging your assets to their full potential can go. New traffic and sales are always a great place to start, but returning customers and loyalty are the pillars of a true market leader.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Oberlo wanted to promote their valuable content to site visitors and collect relevant email leads. To do that, they needed a tool that offered full customization and advanced triggers that would enable them to target individual visitors with the right message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oberlo didn’t have these options with their previous popup tool, but once they tested Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right tool.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Turning Visitors into Quality Email Leads</h2>



<p>Oberlo provides access to a large number of eBooks, hubs, and online courses, and they wanted to use this content to build a relevant email list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One campaign offers a free eBook in exchange for an email address:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup features an illustration of the eBook, which makes it possible for visitors to visualize the value of what they’re getting.</p>



<p>This popup triggers after visitors have been on the site for 10 seconds or if a visitor is about to leave the site. This ensures a better user experience,&nbsp; as visitors get a chance to view the content of the page before getting the offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining a timed trigger with an exit-intent trigger, Oberlo ensures that every visitor gets a chance to download the eBook before they leave the site.</p>



<p>With this specific campaign, Oberlo collected more than 5,000 unique leads in just 6 days.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<p>Oberlo has also excluded existing subscribers from seeing this popup, as these people have already given their email address once.</p>



<p>Lastly, Oberlo has excluded this popup from showing on their other eBook pages where the call-to-action is different, making sure that it only appears when it’s relevant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>From Visitor to Subscriber</h2>



<p>Oberlo also uses Sleeknote to collect newsletter permissions on their individual eBook pages:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif" alt="Oberlo-Ebook" class="wp-image-95462" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-300x169.gif 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-768x432.gif 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-380x214.gif 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-600x338.gif 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-760x428.gif 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-62x35.gif 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-89x50.gif 89w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-740x416.gif 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-220x124.gif 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-385x217.gif 385w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup is triggered with javascript, meaning it doesn’t show unless visitors click the “Download” button.</p>



<p>When visitors click the “Download” button, they don’t know they have to enter their name and email address. And yet, 96.92% of the visitors who did decided to follow-through and provide their details in exchange for the eBook.</p>



<p>That’s impressive, and it’s among the highest conversion rates we’ve ever seen for a campaign like this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails that Oberlo collects are segmented into different email lists based on what kind of eBook they have downloaded. By segmenting leads, Oberlo ensures that leads enter the most relevant email onboarding flow.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A/B Testing to Find the Best Performing Popup</h2>



<p>To ensure that their campaigns are always optimized, Oberlo does a lot of A/B testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They recently created an A/B test to see if a top bar without an eBook offer would outperform their slide-in with the eBook offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the top bar:</p>

<p>And the slide-in:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<p>The results showed that the slide-in with the eBook offer performed 2000% better than the bar, underlining how important it is to offer an incentive in your popups.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>Siva’s favorite Sleeknote feature is the teaser.</p>



<p>The teaser is a small bar that shows at the bottom of the screen when your popup has yet to be triggered or after it’s been closed. On mobile, the teaser will show first and the popup will only trigger if a visitor clicks to learn more.</p>

<p>Sofacompany was missing high-quality leads for their email list. To solve the problem, they started looking for a tool that could provide them with a large number of high-quality leads and they chose Sleeknote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some time, they started to explore how Sleeknote could be used in other ways. Today, Sofacompany use Sleeknote beyond lead capture, resulting in not only leads but also better customer service and customer insights.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Offering a Free Sample</h2>



<p>Sofacompany knows how difficult it can be for online shoppers to find the right product without having a chance to feel or touch the product. So, they use a Sleeknote campaign on their sofa product pages to offer visitors free fabric samples.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample.jpg" alt="Offering a Free Sample" class="wp-image-95437" width="300" height="319" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-283x300.jpg 283w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-380x403.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-33x35.jpg 33w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-47x50.jpg 47w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-462x490.jpg 462w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-220x234.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-385x409.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign has a conversion rate of 4.1%. That means more than 4,000 site visitors have signed up to get free fabric samples, giving Sofacompany 4,000+ potential customers to reach out to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the major problems that online retailers face is that customers still like to see a product before making a purchase online, especially for furniture and other more expensive items.</p>



<p>The free samples give customers a chance to see and touch the fabric before deciding on a piece of furniture. This is an experience that can never be gained from looking at pictures online.</p>



<p>According to Maria Mai Hansen, Sofacompany’s Customer Service Department is experiencing more satisfied customers, because they have had a chance to feel the fabric before purchase, removing a lot of insecurity for the customers.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Building a Strong Email List with Competitions</h2>



<p>For e-commerce businesses, contests are typically effective. Customers like receiving free things and are excited about the possibility of winning something of value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sofacompany also decided to implement a competition to generate leads, making it possible to win a gift card when signing up for Sofacompany’s newsletter.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions.jpg" alt="Building a Strong Email List with Competitions" class="wp-image-95429" width="300" height="464" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-194x300.jpg 194w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-380x588.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-23x35.jpg 23w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-32x50.jpg 32w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-317x490.jpg 317w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-220x340.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Strong-Email-List-with-Competitions-385x595.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>With the prize being a gift card of 1000 kr., Sofacompany has been able to generate relevant leads. The gift card can only be used for Sofacompany’s products.</p>



<p>So, instead of receiving something for free and never engaging with Sofacompany, winners would still have to buy something from Sofacompany.</p>



<p>The campaign was very successful for Sofacompany, resulting in a conversion rate as high as 13.07% from site visitors to email leads.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Improving Customer Service</h2>



<p>Sofacompany offers customers the opportunity to customize the designs of their furniture, choosing the fabric, color, and more. When customers order a customized piece of furniture, the delivery times are naturally longer, and customers need to pay a deposit when they place the order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sofacompany knows how important it is to inform visitors about the delay and deposit, so they implemented a Sleeknote campaign telling visitors what to expect when they place a custom order.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service.jpg" alt="Improving Customer Service" class="wp-image-95433" width="450" height="471" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service.jpg 900w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-287x300.jpg 287w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-768x803.jpg 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-380x397.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-600x627.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-760x795.jpg 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-33x35.jpg 33w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-48x50.jpg 48w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-469x490.jpg 469w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-220x230.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Improving-Customer-Service-385x403.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Today, Sofacompany has a Sleekbox with the above information. The campaign has reduced the number of unsatisfied customers dramatically.</p>



<p>Customers are now aware of the longer delivery time and deposit resulting in a much better customer experience. Instead of the longer delivery time being a source of irritation, customers can now look forward to receiving their new couch, as expectations have been clarified.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="706" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights.jpg" alt="Valuable Insights" class="wp-image-95449" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-255x300.jpg 255w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-380x447.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-30x35.jpg 30w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-42x50.jpg 42w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-416x490.jpg 416w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-220x259.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-385x453.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Around 60% of customers have answered the four-question survey. As the survey is shown on order confirmation pages, after a purchase has been made, customers are invested and excited about the product and are more eager to answer a short survey.</p>



<p>Typically, placing a survey on an order confirmation page will result in higher conversion rates than if the survey is placed on other pages around a site, where the customer has not yet made a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey gave Sofacompany valuable insights into their showrooms. One of the questions was “Have you visited one of our showrooms before making this purchase?” to which 70% of customers answered yes, and Sofacompany now know how important the showrooms are to potential customers.</p>



<p>The showrooms provide the possibility of looking at the furniture in real life before ordering, something that a purely online shop cannot provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey also revealed information about their customers’ age and where they live, making Sofacompany able to target customers more precisely.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Knowing how important it is to have a relevant email list packed with relevant prospects, Bolia needed to collect high quality leads for their email list.</p>



<p>With the vast amount of traffic they’re getting to their different sites, Bolia knew they could turn visitors into quality leads with the right popup tool. And after testing Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right solution.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>



<p>Getting new email subscribers is one of Bolia’s top priorities. To get visitors to sign up for their newsletter, Bolia offers visitors a 10% discount when visitors sign up for their newsletter.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="464" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-1024x464.jpg" alt="The Perfect Timing" class="wp-image-95424" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-1024x464.jpg 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-300x136.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-768x348.jpg 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-380x172.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-600x272.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-760x345.jpg 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-77x35.jpg 77w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-110x50.jpg 110w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-740x335.jpg 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-220x100.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-385x175.jpg 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Bolia wanted to experiment with the timing of the popup and decided to try a 15-second timer, meaning the popup will only show to visitors who have been on a page for more than 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though 15 seconds might seem like a long time, waiting longer to show the popup created a better user experience. This is because it gave visitors a chance to see the Bolia collection before deciding whether or not to join the newsletter.</p>



<p>Like many online retailers, Bolia also informs visitors about cookies on their site. They needed to make sure the popup wouldn’t show until visitors had accepted cookies, so they added a condition to ensure that their newsletter popup only shows after a visitor has accepted cookies.</p>



<p>By testing the timing of their popup, Bolia found an effective formula to turn site visitors into email leads. This newsletter campaign had a conversion rate of 7.2%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Multiple Platforms</h2>



<p>Bolia also uses competitions to build its email list. To ensure a high-quality customer journey on both desktop and mobile, Bolia creates desktop- and mobile-specific campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They started to experiment with images and the amount of text in their desktop vs. mobile popups. Bolia found that their desktop popups perform better when they include images and details on what visitors get when they enter the competition and sign up for the Bolia newsletter.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On mobile, Bolia found that removing images and using less text created a more user-friendly mobile popup. By doing so, they ensure that the popup doesn’t take up too much screen space on mobile devices.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Bolia also knows how important it is to adapt the messages to their different audiences. They’ve found that offering a 10% discount in France and the Netherlands in exchange for an email is extremely effective, whereas competitions are more effective for their Danish audience. (The French and Dutch campaigns’ conversion rates are 13.46% and 10.45% respectively.)</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Choosing the Best Design</h2>



<p>Another feature Bolia takes advantage of is A/B testing. In one experiment, Bolia tested its mobile teaser’s background color on its German mobile popups. One version was blue and the other was orange.</p>

<p>In English, the text reads: Win designs from our new collection.</p>



<p>The orange teaser performed 327% better than the blue teaser. On desktop though, the results were reversed. The blue color outperformed the orange teaser, which goes to show how important it is to test on mobile and desktop separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difference could also be a result of the fact that the desktop version includes product images that go better with the blue color than the orange.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Roede needed a simple and flexible tool to inform visitors and customers about new products and other new initiatives. They also needed to build a strong email list of potential customers for their email marketing.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>



<p>Roede uses Sleeknote to communicate new offers to new visitors. One of these offers is a new course called Kickstart that Roede wanted to promote. They created a simple campaign to inform visitors of the new course.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="505" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-1024x505.jpg" alt="Sleekboc 1" class="wp-image-95383" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-1024x505.jpg 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-300x148.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-768x379.jpg 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-380x187.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-600x296.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-760x375.jpg 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-71x35.jpg 71w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-101x50.jpg 101w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-740x365.jpg 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-220x109.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1-385x190.jpg 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekboc-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign has a conversion rate of 44.17%. That means almost half the people who see this campaign click through to read more about the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s not all. This campaign also reduced the amount of questions Roede’s customer service would get about the new course, freeing up more time for other support inquiries.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Roede Collected More Than 10,000 Leads in Just 4 Months</h2>



<p>Roede collects relevant emails by offering visitors the opportunity to enter a contest. The prizes vary depending on what the offer of the week is. One example is this campaign offering a chance to win a Polar activity watch:</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>One of Kjetil’s favorite Sleeknote features is the Specific URL condition. He knows how important it is to target the right visitors with the right messages. With the URL condition, Roede ensures that certain campaigns are only shown on relevant pages.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-background" style="background-color:#f5f5f5"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Pro Tip</h2>



<p>Kjetil always visits the website in incognito mode when activating new campaigns on the site. That way he can quickly check if their campaigns targeting new visitors show in the right places at the right time.</p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Kjetil also likes Sleeknote’s direct integration with Mailchimp.</p>

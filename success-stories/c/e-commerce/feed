<h2><strong>Simply Wanting More</strong></h2>



<p>In 2018, it became clear to Grafical that they were missing out on a lot of potential customers and leads. They knew that they could do better, and therefore, they started looking for a tool that could help decrease their bounce rate and increase their lead generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their search they came across Sleeknote and have since used the software to develop several campaigns for their website that have helped them achieve just what they were hoping for. Since beginning to use Sleeknote they have seen conversion rates of over 20 percent. This is not the average conversion rate, of course, but it shows just how impressive results they have seen by using Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Seeing the Results They Were Hoping For</strong></h2>



<p>Grafical has multiple active campaigns with Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy they use is to give out a small discount voucher to those that sign up for their newsletter. One campaign can be found on their landing page, where a small teaser appears in the bottom left corner:&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="603" height="112" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28.png" alt="Grafical SS 5" class="wp-image-114667" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28.png 603w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-300x56.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-380x71.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-600x111.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-180x33.png 180w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-250x46.png 250w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-220x41.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-13.34.28-385x72.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></figure></div>



<p>This unfolds to a more elaborate pop-up that informs the visitor that all they need to do is sign up for the newsletter and then they will receive a 10% discount.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="652" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-1024x652.png" alt="Grafical SS 1" class="wp-image-114651" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-1024x652.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-300x191.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-768x489.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-380x242.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-600x382.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-760x484.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-55x35.png 55w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-78x50.png 78w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-740x471.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-220x140.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48-385x245.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.38.48.png 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It can be just that simple. This campaign generates approximately 1,200 new leads for Grafical, every month!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another campaign they have had great success with, and continue to have great success with, is their exit-intent pop-up. One of the problems they were experiencing before Sleeknote was their bounce rate. With the use of Sleeknote they have made this campaign:&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="827" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-1024x827.png" alt="Grafical SS 4" class="wp-image-114663" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-1024x827.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-300x242.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-768x620.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-380x307.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-600x484.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-760x614.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-43x35.png 43w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-62x50.png 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-607x490.png 607w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-220x178.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51-385x311.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-03-at-11.39.51.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This campaign generates more than 300 fresh leads every month, and even though it doesn’t ensure that the visitor completes their purchase, it does enable Grafical to contact them afterwards.&nbsp;These were customers that were about to leave the site!</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Continuous Success Made Easy</strong></h2>



<p>There are several reasons why Grafical have continued to use Sleeknote but the main reason is the ease and the automation of a software that continues to provide good results. As Benjamin, the marketing and web assistant at Grafical put it when describing how they use Sleeknote right now:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“This might sound negative, it’s definitely not supposed to, but everything just runs automatically and takes care of itself.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grafical’s campaigns continue to be successful and therefore, there is no need for new campaigns or to constantly monitor or alter them. The campaigns generate hundreds of new leads every month, and it is the main reason why Grafical is so happy with their use of Sleeknote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also some other reasons why they have not looked for another option:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sleeknote is Easy.</strong> The employees at Grafical think that Sleeknote is simple and easy to use, and it enables them to be creative in their own way.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The Employees are Helpful.</strong> Whenever there is a problem or something that they do not know the help is only a mere call or chat away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Available Numbers.</strong> The analytics feature of Sleeknote makes it so easy to keep track of how well the campaigns are doing, and also stay on top of the leads that have been generated.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Embracing Events With Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<p>One way that Grafical&nbsp; has yet to take advantage of Sleeknote is to prepare for the major sales holidays and events that happen throughout the year. This is something that they aim to improve in the future by getting help from Sleeknote to get ready for Black Friday, January sales and other large events that they still have to make easier for themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be used for any kind of holiday or event. In many occasions it is just about gaining the attention of the consumer, and making them aware of what you can do for them. Like this Sleekbar, where Grafical informs their visitors about their assortment of hand sanitiser and masks in this time of Covid-19:&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is about seeing the opportunities in all events and crises.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Increasing Transactions with Managed Solution</h2>



<p>Back in March 2019, Kings &amp; Queens started working with Sleeknote Managed Solution and ViaBill (an installment plan payment option). The goal was to promote the option to pay with ViaBill and increase the number of ViaBill transactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/managed-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sleeknote Managed Solution</a> is the newest in-house Sleeknote service, where conversion optimization experts manage your Sleeknote account with the purpose of generating more leads, boosting sales, and providing a better user experience on the customer’s site.</p>



<p>After three months, Kings &amp; Queens’ results speak for themselves:</p>



<ul><li>The number of ViaBill transactions has <strong>increased by 69.68% </strong>(subject to seasonal fluctuations)</li><li>The conversion rate for e-commerce on selected offers and campaigns has <strong>increased by 522.52%</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li>They’ve <strong>collected more than 8,000 newsletter subscribers.</strong></li></ul>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Promoting the New Payment Option</h2>



<p>To promote the option to pay with ViaBill, the Managed Solution team set up a campaign to create awareness around the alternative payment option.</p>



<p>The campaign promotes the advantages of choosing ViaBill as a payment option.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="308" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg" alt="Promoting the New Payment Option Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95529" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-300x243.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-43x35.jpg 43w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-62x50.jpg 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-220x178.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Boosting Sales with Category-Specific Campaigns</h2>



<p>The Managed Solution team set up several different campaigns on the Kings &amp; Queens website to promote relevant offers (e.g. two t-shirts for 200 DKK).</p>



<p>With Sleeknote, it’s possible to trigger the campaigns on specific URLs and for specific site visitors.</p>



<p>“We’ve struggled with promoting the offers we’ve had on the site–especially the ones where you can buy two or three t-shirts and get a discount.” says e-commerce manager, Ronni Andersen. “But because Sleeknote is so flexible, we can have specific campaigns with our Tommy Hilfiger t-shirts on our Tommy Hilfiger category page.”</p>

<p>With a campaign promoting offers on relevant products, Kings &amp; Queens are able to give their visitors the feeling of being guided to better purchase decisions–just like they would in a physical store.</p>



<p>And these campaigns have paid off.</p>



<p>Their campaign promoting two t-shirts for DKK 200, has <strong>increased their conversion rate by 522%.</strong></p>



<p>That means 10% of visitors that clicked the campaign made a purchase. And out of the visitors who saw the campaign but didn’t click through, 1.61% converted into customers in the same period.</p>

<h2>A Flexible Tool for Mid-Season Sale</h2>



<p>From May 1st, 2019 to May 15th, 2019, Kings &amp; Queens had a mid-season sale. During this time, Ronni was happy to have Sleeknote as a tool and the Managed Solution team for assistance.</p>



<p>“It made a lot of sense for us to have Sleeknote during our mid-season sale where we had four different campaigns running,” says Ronni. “One [campaign] without a countdown timer at the beginning of the sale, and one at the end of the sale to increase urgency. These two campaigns were created for both desktop and mobile individually.” But that’s not even the best part.</p>



<p>“I was on vacation at the time of the sale. But with the advanced scheduling option and Managed Solution’s help, I was able to let go of the reins, knowing everything would be on track and run smoothly.”</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The campaign with a countdown timer <strong>increased conversions by 215.09%</strong> and the campaign without the countdown timer saw <strong>an increase of 216.98%</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A More Effective Way to Collect Leads</h2>



<p>With 19 physical stores, it’s been difficult for Kings &amp; Queens to control their newsletter signups from their KingsQueens.dk’ headquarters.</p>



<p>Ronni explains: “Before we started using Sleeknote, we only collected leads in our physical stores and they weren’t coming in consistently. With the new Sleeknote campaign on our site, we know that every visitor is presented with the opportunity to sign up. This is much more effective than being dependent on the sales assistants in the stores who don’t always remember to ask.”</p>

<h2>An Obvious Cooperation</h2>

<h2>The Value of Email Marketing</h2>



<p>When it comes to online marketing, your email list is one of your most valuable resources. In fact, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Email-Continues-Deliver-Strong-ROI-Value-Marketers/1014461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one study</a> found that emails are the most cost efficient online marketing channel, having an average ROI of 122%.</p>



<p>Horze’ marketing strategy is focused on many channels but one of the biggest is their email contacts. Recently, the marketing team invested in a new ESP system and lead generation is crucial in order to reach their KPI goals and succeed.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Horze Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Soon after using Sleeknote, Horze on-page conversion rate went from 2% to 5%. This alone would have been a satisfying achievement, but they decided to push forward and see how high the conversion could get. To do this, they explored the A/B testing feature and saw an increase in the on-page conversion rate from 6.7% to 26.9%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Horze Grew Their Email List Using Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Horze used Sleeknote to get qualified leads for their newsletter. The first way they did this was by offering discounts to new visitors.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>They also created competitions and split test different prizes to determine which were most likely to convince visitors to subscribe to their newsletter.</p>



<p>A perfect example of this is the A/B test for offering a winter turnout blanket versus a gift card, which showed that using the gift card as a prize increased the conversion rate by 298%.</p>

<h2>Big Brother</h2>



<p>Boozt.com has built a well-known brand in the Nordic countries over the last nine years, as a premium store. Three years ago, they started expanding into the mid-range price segment through a new outlet, Booztlet.com.</p>



<p>Over these three years, Booztlet’s massive growth has taken the company by storm. In fact, their current predictions place Booztlet as a growth driver for the entire company, over the next three-to-five years. This makes maintaining and accelerating growth a top priority for Kim Vile, Boozt’s E-Commerce Director.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Growing Pains</h2>



<p>As a new company, establishing a fast pace of growth is natural, but maintaining it throughout the years is the real challenge. The common view of growth identifies two key processes: acquiring new customers and retaining old ones.</p>



<p>Booztlet tackles the mid-range price segment, so a big part of their sales revolve around special offers, discounts, and deals. At first, they ran weekly campaigns on their site, including special deals and discounts that all of their visitors had access to. While they had a positive impact on sales, these campaigns did little in terms of customer retention. To use them to their full potential, Kim Vile turned them into incentives for signing up to the company’s newsletter, by making them exclusive to subscribers. In doing so, he created a “low-key loyalty membership.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Booztlet Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet uses their newsletter to create desire and interest through new collections and special deals sent to subscribers, as well as improving their on-site experience through direct access to their weekly campaigns. As of writing, it accounts for half of the company’s sales, making it a crucial part of their marketing strategy. The strategy for the newsletter is even more ambitious in the long run, aiming to introduce more personalized campaigns and on-site interactions for subscribers down the line. In either case, it plays—and will continue to play—a major role in Booztlet’s marketing strategy in the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In order to increase newsletter signups, Kim looked for ways to engage visitors on-site and make opting in simple. “I’m using Sleeknote for its rules,” Kim told me. “It’s just so easy to set when, where and how often to show your campaigns. Without any technical knowledge, you can set up a campaign within five minutes.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Booztlet Used Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet turned their weekly campaigns into incentives for signing up to their newsletter, by making the best deals and discounts exclusive to subscribers. They did this in two ways: by sending them newsletters about the latest offers, as well as using cookies on-site to differentiate between new visitors and subscribers. In doing so, subscribers were given access to the discounts immediately, while new visitors were shown the SleekBox below.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="624" height="292" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png" alt="Booztlet-SleekBox-1" class="wp-image-95483" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png 624w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-300x140.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-380x178.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-600x281.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-75x35.png 75w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-107x50.png 107w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-220x103.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-385x180.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This simple concept proved to be extremely effective, generating leads for Booztlet’s newsletter on their international site, as well as their specific Danish, Finnish and Swedish sites.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they used Sleeknote’s cookie tracking capabilities to show on-site messages and offers only to their newsletter subscribers. One example is the SleekBar below they used to showcase a “Get 4, Pay only for 3” exclusive deal to visitors holding the “subscriber” cookie.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>By tweaking a system Booztlet already had in place, namely their weekly campaigns, and turning it into a signup incentive, they were able to not only increase sales but keep their existing customers interested and coming back for new deals and discounts.</p>



<p>Boozlet’s position as a growth driver for a company as massive as Boozt proves how far leveraging your assets to their full potential can go. New traffic and sales are always a great place to start, but returning customers and loyalty are the pillars of a true market leader.</p>

<p>Sofacompany was missing high-quality leads for their email list. To solve the problem, they started looking for a tool that could provide them with a large number of high-quality leads and they chose Sleeknote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some time, they started to explore how Sleeknote could be used in other ways. Today, Sofacompany use Sleeknote beyond lead capture, resulting in not only leads but also better customer service and customer insights.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Offering a Free Sample</h2>



<p>Sofacompany knows how difficult it can be for online shoppers to find the right product without having a chance to feel or touch the product. So, they use a Sleeknote campaign on their sofa product pages to offer visitors free fabric samples.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample.jpg" alt="Offering a Free Sample" class="wp-image-95437" width="300" height="319" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-283x300.jpg 283w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-380x403.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-33x35.jpg 33w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-47x50.jpg 47w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-462x490.jpg 462w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-220x234.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Offering-a-Free-Sample-385x409.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign has a conversion rate of 4.1%. That means more than 4,000 site visitors have signed up to get free fabric samples, giving Sofacompany 4,000+ potential customers to reach out to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the major problems that online retailers face is that customers still like to see a product before making a purchase online, especially for furniture and other more expensive items.</p>



<p>The free samples give customers a chance to see and touch the fabric before deciding on a piece of furniture. This is an experience that can never be gained from looking at pictures online.</p>



<p>According to Maria Mai Hansen, Sofacompany’s Customer Service Department is experiencing more satisfied customers, because they have had a chance to feel the fabric before purchase, removing a lot of insecurity for the customers.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Building a Strong Email List with Competitions</h2>



<p>For e-commerce businesses, contests are typically effective. Customers like receiving free things and are excited about the possibility of winning something of value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sofacompany also decided to implement a competition to generate leads, making it possible to win a gift card when signing up for Sofacompany’s newsletter.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>With the prize being a gift card of 1000 kr., Sofacompany has been able to generate relevant leads. The gift card can only be used for Sofacompany’s products.</p>



<p>So, instead of receiving something for free and never engaging with Sofacompany, winners would still have to buy something from Sofacompany.</p>



<p>The campaign was very successful for Sofacompany, resulting in a conversion rate as high as 13.07% from site visitors to email leads.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Improving Customer Service</h2>



<p>Sofacompany offers customers the opportunity to customize the designs of their furniture, choosing the fabric, color, and more. When customers order a customized piece of furniture, the delivery times are naturally longer, and customers need to pay a deposit when they place the order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sofacompany knows how important it is to inform visitors about the delay and deposit, so they implemented a Sleeknote campaign telling visitors what to expect when they place a custom order.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Today, Sofacompany has a Sleekbox with the above information. The campaign has reduced the number of unsatisfied customers dramatically.</p>



<p>Customers are now aware of the longer delivery time and deposit resulting in a much better customer experience. Instead of the longer delivery time being a source of irritation, customers can now look forward to receiving their new couch, as expectations have been clarified.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Valuable Insights</h2>



<p>To learn more about their customers, Sofacompany decided to implement a survey on their order confirmation pages.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="706" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights.jpg" alt="Valuable Insights" class="wp-image-95449" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-255x300.jpg 255w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-380x447.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-30x35.jpg 30w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-42x50.jpg 42w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-416x490.jpg 416w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-220x259.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Valuable-Insights-385x453.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Around 60% of customers have answered the four-question survey. As the survey is shown on order confirmation pages, after a purchase has been made, customers are invested and excited about the product and are more eager to answer a short survey.</p>



<p>Typically, placing a survey on an order confirmation page will result in higher conversion rates than if the survey is placed on other pages around a site, where the customer has not yet made a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey gave Sofacompany valuable insights into their showrooms. One of the questions was “Have you visited one of our showrooms before making this purchase?” to which 70% of customers answered yes, and Sofacompany now know how important the showrooms are to potential customers.</p>



<p>The showrooms provide the possibility of looking at the furniture in real life before ordering, something that a purely online shop cannot provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey also revealed information about their customers’ age and where they live, making Sofacompany able to target customers more precisely.</p>

<h2>Sofacompany’s Recommendation</h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-plum-color has-text-color" style="font-size:24px"><em>“Sleeknote is so easy to work with. It is intuitive. I am convinced that everyone would be able to figure it out. If I ever experience a problem, I just write to support and always get quick and detailed answers back. I have no doubts afterwards.”</em></p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Besides the fast and easy support, Maria also likes the fact that she can call for advice or get ideas on how Sleeknote can be used even better.</p>



<p>It is always possible to get the support you need, whether it is a problem that you can’t figure out how to fix or if you just need some guidance.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Knowing how important it is to have a relevant email list packed with relevant prospects, Bolia needed to collect high quality leads for their email list.</p>



<p>With the vast amount of traffic they’re getting to their different sites, Bolia knew they could turn visitors into quality leads with the right popup tool. And after testing Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right solution.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>



<p>Getting new email subscribers is one of Bolia’s top priorities. To get visitors to sign up for their newsletter, Bolia offers visitors a 10% discount when visitors sign up for their newsletter.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="464" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-1024x464.jpg" alt="The Perfect Timing" class="wp-image-95424" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-1024x464.jpg 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-300x136.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-768x348.jpg 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-380x172.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-600x272.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-760x345.jpg 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-77x35.jpg 77w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-110x50.jpg 110w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-740x335.jpg 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-220x100.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing-385x175.jpg 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Perfect-Timing.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Bolia wanted to experiment with the timing of the popup and decided to try a 15-second timer, meaning the popup will only show to visitors who have been on a page for more than 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though 15 seconds might seem like a long time, waiting longer to show the popup created a better user experience. This is because it gave visitors a chance to see the Bolia collection before deciding whether or not to join the newsletter.</p>



<p>Like many online retailers, Bolia also informs visitors about cookies on their site. They needed to make sure the popup wouldn’t show until visitors had accepted cookies, so they added a condition to ensure that their newsletter popup only shows after a visitor has accepted cookies.</p>



<p>By testing the timing of their popup, Bolia found an effective formula to turn site visitors into email leads. This newsletter campaign had a conversion rate of 7.2%.</p>

<p>Bolia also uses competitions to build its email list. To ensure a high-quality customer journey on both desktop and mobile, Bolia creates desktop- and mobile-specific campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They started to experiment with images and the amount of text in their desktop vs. mobile popups. Bolia found that their desktop popups perform better when they include images and details on what visitors get when they enter the competition and sign up for the Bolia newsletter.</p>

<p>Bolia also knows how important it is to adapt the messages to their different audiences. They’ve found that offering a 10% discount in France and the Netherlands in exchange for an email is extremely effective, whereas competitions are more effective for their Danish audience. (The French and Dutch campaigns’ conversion rates are 13.46% and 10.45% respectively.)</p>

<p>Another feature Bolia takes advantage of is A/B testing. In one experiment, Bolia tested its mobile teaser’s background color on its German mobile popups. One version was blue and the other was orange.</p>

<p>In English, the text reads: Win designs from our new collection.</p>



<p>The orange teaser performed 327% better than the blue teaser. On desktop though, the results were reversed. The blue color outperformed the orange teaser, which goes to show how important it is to test on mobile and desktop separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difference could also be a result of the fact that the desktop version includes product images that go better with the blue color than the orange.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>



<p>As with many online stores, Pilgrim wanted to grow their email list with relevant email leads. They needed a tool that was easy to customize and offered the flexibility to target visitors in different languages on their different sites.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Collecting Relevant Emails</h2>



<p>To incentivize visitors to sign up for their newsletter, Pilgrim offers a 10% discount on visitors’ first purchase.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="488" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-1024x488.jpg" alt="Collecting Relevant Emails" class="wp-image-95345" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-300x143.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-768x366.jpg 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-380x181.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-600x286.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-760x362.jpg 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-73x35.jpg 73w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-105x50.jpg 105w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-740x353.jpg 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-220x105.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails-385x184.jpg 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collecting-Relevant-Emails.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This popup is shown on Pilgrim’s inspiration pages where visitors can find inspiration for how to style their jewellery.</p>



<p>These pages are optimized for Google rankings, so when visitors search Google for certain phrases related to Pilgrim’s product line, such as ‘gold jewellery’, it’s the inspiration pages that visitors see first.</p>



<p>This campaign is especially effective on these pages because visitors looking for inspiration on jewellery are more likely to also be interested in getting inspiration and offers from Pilgrim in their inbox.</p>



<p>Pilgrim’s website has been translated into the languages of its target markets and so has its newsletter campaign.</p>



<p>Translating the campaign into different languages has resulted in almost half the visitors on the inspiration pages converting into email leads on the Swedish (50%), German (47%), and the Norwegian (37%) site.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, these campaigns have generated more than 65,000 leads.</p>



<p>Pilgrim also tested a time-limited campaign. In this campaign, they partnered with Boozt to test a different incentive. Visitors were offered a chance to win two tickets to a Boozt fashion show and a gift card to use on Pilgrim’s online store.</p>



<p>Pilgrim used a Facebook ad to generate traffic to the landing page with the offer. If visitors wanted the offer, they had to click a link to trigger the email popup:</p>

<p>This campaign produced a conversion rate of <strong>76%.</strong></p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A Pleasant Surprise</h2>



<p>Pilgrim also wanted to see if they could turn abandoning visitors into email leads by using an exit-intent popup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months ago, they decided to try it, and created an exit-intent campaign offering a 10% discount in exchange for an email address.</p>

<p>The UK campaign alone has generated more than 5000 leads already.</p>



<p>Pilgrim is also planning to create a campaign that tells visitors the amount they need to spend to qualify for free shipping.</p>



<p>The hope is that this will increase the average order value per customer, and Sonia is confident it will perform well.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Since implementing Sleeknote, Pilgrim has collected more than 67,000 new email leads for their newsletter across all their sites.</p>



<p>They continue to experiment with new features to ensure they always have the best performing campaigns on their site.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>Lakrids needed a smart and effective way to get more signups for their newsletter. They needed a tool that&nbsp; was integratable with Mailchimp, easy to implement and worked with Shopify. Sleeknote met all the criterias and more.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Increase Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>We were looking for a smart and effective way to get more signups for our newsletter. We knew that slide-ins and popups were a great way to capture leads, so we started looking for a tool that could do this. The main criteria for the tool was that it was integratable with Mailchimp, easy to implement and worked with Shopify. Sleeknote met all the criteria and more.</p>



<p>Today, our main purpose with Sleeknote is still to get signups for our newsletter. It’s important to us that we only send emails to people who actually want them, and by using Sleeknote we ensure this, as people voluntarily enter their email in our SleekBoxes.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Guiding Customers</h3>



<p>We also use Sleeknote for service messages. Once, some of our shipments to Germany were delayed due to a heatwave. To avoid doubt and a high number of calls to our customer service, we created a SleekBox informing people of the situation.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;We released our Swedish website a month ago, and the sleeknote on this site has a conversion rate of 11,2 % and has already collected more than 200 signups.&#8221;    </blockquote>

<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>We’ve noticed a huge difference in the number of signups before and after we started using Sleeknote.</p>



<p>We released our Swedish website a month ago, and the SleekBox on this site has a conversion rate of 11,2 % and has already collected more than 200 signups.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Function or Option?</h2>



<p>I don’t know if it’s a feature or not, but I love the fact that you can put an image on the SleekBox, as it makes it way easier to make the SleekBox fit the layout of the website, which is very important to us. Besides that, I also love how user-friendly the editor is.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Describe Sleeknote with 3 Words</h2>



<p>User-friendly, easy and relevant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Think about what you want to achieve with Sleeknote; More signups, more social followers, promotion or something else?</p>



<p>Give it a try and test what works and what doesn’t. Remember to design your SleekBox so it matches the layout of your website. Then your visitors won’t see it as an “external” popup, but more like a part of your website.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>I’ve actually never needed to talk with your support as your dashboard is so user-friendly.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Cart Abandonment</h2>



<p>Cart abandonment is a real problem for online retailers. In fact, according to<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Statista</a>, 75,6% of all online shopping carts are abandoned at checkout, resulting in lost sales and revenue. “I had a challenge with the cart abandonment rate being too high on both sites,” Anders told me. “That’s the reason I looked into Sleeknote—to figure out a way to reduce it.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Minimum Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Before using Sleeknote, Minimum had developed their own popup software. While it allowed them to include basic popups on their site, it lacked the ability to target prospects at a specific moment in the buyer’s journey. Anders wanted to find a solution he could use on both minimum.dk and moves.dk that could be customized to target the individual visitor without hurting the user experience.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec27006290a3" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;Before we used Sleeknote, we had our own popup. Just a thing that we developed ourselves. And that worked fine, but the disadvantage is that when you develop something yourself, it doesn’t contain the same rules, logic, figures, and features Sleeknote does.&#8221;    </blockquote>

<h2>How Minimum Reduced Their Cart Abandonment Rate</h2>



<p>In order to convince visitors to complete the checkout, Anders knew he needed a way to reach them before they left, and show them a compelling offer. “What we basically did was offer a 10% discount in a SleekBox on both sites to help abandoning visitors complete their order.”</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Minimum achieved two things with the above approach. “We got the email address, increasing our newsletter database, and then we got visitors to complete their order, so we got a lot of orders, too.” In doing so, they not only ensured that customers completed their orders, but they also increased the chances of extra sales through long-term email marketing.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>By using a cart recovery <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank">SleekBox with an exit-intent trigger</a>, Minimum achieved a conversion rate of 39.5%, thus reducing the cart abandonment rate and generating 9.362 leads for their newsletter.</p>

<h2>Why Apuls Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Apuls faced a problem that many online businesses face today:</p>



<p>They weren’t getting enough information from the people who signed up for their newsletter.</p>



<p>They knew that getting an email address wasn’t enough. Like most companies, they wanted to learn more about their subscribers so they could personalize their email campaigns and increase their email ROI.</p>



<p>Apuls also wanted to provide visitors with relevant information based on their behavior on the site, such as product recommendations, customer service messages, special deals, and so on.</p>



<p>They couldn’t do this with their solution at the time and started looking for a more customizable software to help solve these problems.</p>



<p>Once they found Sleeknote, Casper quickly saw how easy it was to create customized campaigns targeted at individual visitors.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Like many marketers, Casper was afraid that implementing popup campaigns on their site would hurt the user experience. But these concerns disappeared when he saw how he could target individual visitors with just the right information at the right time—without annoying visitors.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Apuls Generates Leads</h2>



<ul><li>Email marketing is an important channel for Apuls. They wanted to create highly segmented email campaigns based on their subscribers’ interests.</li></ul>



<p>But to do so, they needed a tool to help them get information from subscribers that could be used to automate their email marketing.</p>



<p>After trying Sleeknote, Apuls found out that a multistep campaign was the perfect solution for this.</p>



<p>With a multistep campaign, Apuls can ask visitors about their interests upon signup so they get the information right away and don’t have to follow up with email surveys.</p>



<p>Here’s one of the multistep campaigns Apuls uses:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="854" height="480" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1.gif" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95274"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>They know that a visitor who’s interested in say, running equipment, should get running-related email campaigns promoting relevant offers like running gear, supplements, etc.</p>



<p>Knowing the interest of their subscribers enables Apuls to automate a lot of their email marketing while keeping the content relevant to the individual subscriber.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Two Intelligent Ways of Using Exit-Intent</h2>



<p>Apuls has also experimented a lot with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank">Exit-Intent</a> on their site and found two highly effective use cases.</p>



<p>First, Apuls uses an exit-intent campaign to engage abandoning visitors who haven’t added products to their cart. They encourage abandoning visitors to join their exclusive newsletter with new products and great offers.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Apuls wants visitors to stay on their site as long as possible but know that getting a visitor’s email address is more valuable at this point. With an email address, they can create targeted email campaigns for the user and turn them into repeat customers instead of one-time buyers.</p>

<h2>How Apuls Helps Visitors Find the Right Products</h2>



<p>At Apuls, there’s a great focus on providing visitors with the best possible experience. They want to give visitors the same personal guidance you would find in any physical store.</p>



<p>They also realize that with a large product variety, it can be difficult for visitors to find the right product based on their needs.</p>



<p>Apuls uses Sleeknote to help visitors find what they’re looking for with relevant product recommendations based on the product categories they browse.</p>



<p>For example, if a visitor looks at running machines, Apuls shows a campaign with recommendations for running machines in different price ranges so visitors can easily see which machine fits their need and budget.</p>



<p>The teaser:</p>

<p>After implementing segmented campaigns like this on their site, Apuls has seen a significant increase in conversion rates and sales.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Switching From DIY to Managed Solution</h2>



<p>When Apuls first started using Sleeknote, they created and managed campaigns on their own.</p>



<p>When they found out that Sleeknote offers a managed solution—a bespoke done-for-you service—they quickly jumped at this opportunity.</p>



<p>As Casper put it:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/r1t13fjl8l.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_r1t13fjl8l" style="height:360px;position:relative;width:640px"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/r1t13fjl8l/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;"></div></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The switch to managed solution meant that Casper and the rest of the Apuls team now have more time to work on their company mission: giving people the tools and information they need to exercise more and live a healthy active lifestyle.</p>

<p>With the managed solution, Apuls can rest assured that their campaigns are constantly being optimized based on data from more than 15 billion sessions. This data also enables the managed solution team to make data-driven decisions and come up with new ideas.</p>



<p>To begin with, Apuls chose the Essential plan which is the most affordable plan.</p>



<p>In Casper’s words,</p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/9vi2t8mcez.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_9vi2t8mcez" style="height:360px;position:relative;width:640px"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/9vi2t8mcez/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;"></div></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Best Performing Campaigns</h2>



<p>Apuls has great success with their product recommendation campaigns.</p>



<p>One of the best performing campaigns is a campaign on their bicycle product page where they recommend three different bicycles.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Apuls knows that their visitors are at different training levels. So, with that in mind, they showcase a “beginner bike” for those who’re just getting started with cycling and have a smaller budget.</p>



<p>Then, they show a “medium bike” for the more experienced who are looking to take their training to a new level and invest in a bike with more features. The last bike Apuls recommends is a high-performance bike for visitors who want the best of the best.</p>



<p>It can be difficult for visitors to get an overview of the different bikes and decide which one is best for their needs. So by limiting the options and recommending a single bike for each level has proven to be an effective way of helping visitors make that choice.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>The multistep and the countdown timer are two of Casper’s favorite features.</p>



<p>The multistep allows Apuls to get more information from new signups in a very simple and non-intrusive way.</p>



<p>And the countdown timer is used to create urgency in their campaigns. For example, visitors might get a free product if they buy from a specific product category within a certain time frame.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Apuls is experiencing rapid growth and has found a way to personalize their on-site campaigns, email marketing and more to meet the visitor where they are in the customer journey.</p>



<p>Casper has no doubts that personalization is the future of marketing, and if you want to get your audience’s attention and stand out from competitors a simple merge tag isn’t going to cut it.</p>



<p>By implementing Sleeknote on their site, Apuls has been able to take their personalization to a new level which has helped them collect more relevant email addresses for their email marketing, improve the user experience on their site, and increase conversion rates.</p>

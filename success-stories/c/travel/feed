<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Stealing the Customers back from the OTA’s&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is converting website visitors into customers. In the hotel industry, this is especially difficult due to online travel agents (OTAs) that are partners but also, in a way, competitors. Many customers book through OTAs because they present and compare all hotels on price and quality, so the visitors feel they are making an informed decision. Hotels seek to avoid using OTAs and sell directly to the visitors instead so they don’t have to pay up to 25 percent in commission per booking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martijn, the digital marketing coordinator of Sircle Collection, said that he could see that their website had many visitors, but not nearly as many bookings. To help optimize the hotels’ conversion rate, he created a strategy based on using website popups.</p>



<p>He decided to combine popups with persuasion marketing, which enabled him to reach each visitor at the right place, at the right time and offer the right benefit. The popup strategy that Martijn created using Sleeknote consisted of 350+ different popups across all the domains of Sircle Collection.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Why Sircle Collection Chose Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Sleeknote was not the first popup tool that Sircle Collection worked with. Martijn said that they had worked with two other options previously but a combination of the price and ease of using the tool, led Sircle Collection to try Sleeknote, and they have now been using it since the rebranding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An additional factor for Martijn in choosing Sleeknote was that the process of branding was made easy through the tool. This was particularly important due to the rebranding of the company.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Improving the Conversion Rate Using Sleeknote</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Sircle Collection used Sleeknote to create a range of different popups that were to guide the visitor or offer some kind of benefit. The first way they did this was to create a small teaser that would appear on any site to offer each visitor more information about booking through the hotel’s website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When clicked, the user then saw a popup sharing the benefits of booking through the hotel’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="613" height="975" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20.png" alt="Sircle Collections Case Study 3" class="wp-image-111947" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20.png 613w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-189x300.png 189w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-380x604.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-600x954.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-22x35.png 22w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-31x50.png 31w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-308x490.png 308w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-220x350.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-20-385x612.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></figure></div>



<p>Sircle Collection also created an <a href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exit-intent popup</a> that appeared when a visitor had been through certain steps in the booking agent was about to leave. When working with an OTA there is a cost agreement, which means that Sircle Collection is unable to lower the cost of their hotel rooms. They can, however, offer a discount to the visitor, which is what they tried. </p>



<p>Martijn said that this is a win-win for the company and the customer because it makes the room cheaper and most importantly the discount is smaller than the commission of an OTA.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="773" height="923" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19.png" alt="Sircle Collections Case Study 2" class="wp-image-111943" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19.png 773w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-251x300.png 251w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-768x917.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-380x454.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-600x716.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-760x907.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-29x35.png 29w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-42x50.png 42w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-410x490.png 410w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-220x263.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-19-385x460.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></figure></div>



<p>The exit-intent popups offer a promotional code, which makes them measurable because it is registered every time they are used. Sircle Collection has implemented thirteen of these campaigns that have had an average conversion rate of almost <strong>14 percent, </strong>and these are visitors who were about to leave the site. </p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The initial plan for Sircle Collection was to just use Sleeknote to improve the conversion rate, however, Martijn didn’t just stop there. He has successfully used Sleeknote to create awareness about their CSR work, where they have been selling art and donating all the profits to medicines sans frontier (doctors without borders). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="344" height="425" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18.png" alt="Sircle Collections Case Study" class="wp-image-111939" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18.png 344w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18-243x300.png 243w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18-28x35.png 28w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18-40x50.png 40w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-18-220x272.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></figure></div>



<p>Martijn said that this use of Sleeknote was unexpected but a pleasant surprise. Therefore, he has been considering what else he could be doing and is now planning a future project where Sircle Collection will be <a href="https://sleeknote.com/collect-email-addresses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collecting emails</a> and building an email list with the use of Sleeknote.</p>

<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote and What Do You Use It for Today?</h2>



<p>We chose Sleeknote as a part of our marketing automation strategy. We wanted to increase the basket size and collect more leads to work with and potentially convert those leads into customers.</p>



<p>Sleeknote is now implemented in about eight of our markets – the markets handle independently how much they use Sleeknote and for what. We have just made Sleeknote available to them, but we know that most of the markets use Sleeknote to collect signups for their newsletter.</p>



<p>Here is an example of the SleekBox that DFDS use on the Danish market. The SleekBox has been viewed +499,000 times and has acquired 15,247 leads which give a 3,1 % conversion rate.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="758" height="435" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox.png" alt="sleekbox" class="wp-image-94876" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox.png 758w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-300x172.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-380x218.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-600x344.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-61x35.png 61w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-87x50.png 87w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-740x425.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-220x126.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox-385x221.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Since the markets handle Sleeknote independently, it’s quite different what results they have achieved.</p>



<p>In the first 3 months of 2016, our Sleeknote on the UK-market has generated around 6,500 leads and has an average conversion rate of 3,2%.</p>

<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>We know that the UK market has been very happy to use the A/B split testing function, as they have been testing out a lot of different models.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>No remarks. The service has been excellent all the way through. The people behind Sleeknote have been great at staying in touch and listening to our needs.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>Vertical Playground needed an onsite engagement tool to collect new signups for their email list.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Build Email List</h3>



<p>Vertical Playground uses Sleeknote to get signups for their newsletter. Their exemplar SleekBox has a conversion rate of 3,3%</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Guide Visitors</h3>



<p>Besides getting signups for our newsletter, we also use Sleeknote to deliver messages to our visitors on certain pages. This could be whenever we have a new product or collection, we design a sleeknote with the text: “New collection just arrived, check it out here”. This is a good way to direct our visitors to another page, and create awareness around new products.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is the Best Thing About Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>The best thing is how easy it is to set up. The implementation took no time, and it’s easy to create new SleekBoxes and customize all the elements in the popup. Also, it’s of high importance that it actually works and collects new email addresses for our lists – And it does!</p>

</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results With Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>With our old newsletter signup form we saw a very low conversion rate, and didn’t get nearly as many signups as we do with Sleeknote. You can easily say that the number of signups has increased plenty fold after we started using Sleeknote.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is the First Word That Comes to Your Mind When You Think of Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Excellent service, user friendly and very customizable.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Would You Recommend, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Use the A/B Split test function right away! We’ve done a lot of split testing, and by doing split tests you’re able to find out what works and what doesn’t. Today we know a lot more about what kind of opt-ins our customers like, than we did the first time we used Sleeknote.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>No remarks. The customer service is excellent.</p>

<h2>What Was Your Goal, When You Started Using Sleeknote?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Collecting Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>We started with Twami, where our focus was lead generation and to get people to sign up for our newsletter. In the travel industry, a newsletter is very effective and important. A trip has a high degree of involvement, and the customers often read a newsletter before buying a trip. Our goal was therefore to increase our database, so we could reach more people with our newsletter.</p>



<p>When Twami turned into Sleeknote, there were added additional features, which we started using. An example is that we merged with In-Italia and In-France, which we run from the same Sleeknote account.</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Informing Visitors</h3>



<p>Furthermore, we use the blank SleekBox, if there are technical errors on our website. It is a smart and easy way to inform the visitors that there are currently technical errors on the website, but that they will be sorted out as soon as possible. When we have these technical errors, we use the option that the Sleeknote must be shown after 5 seconds on the same page. Another thing we highly appreciate is the API integration since it saves us a lot of work because we do not need to move the leads from Sleeknote to the newsletter session.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Has Sleeknote Helped You With?</h2>



<p>Hideaways has received a lot of newsletter subscriptions and inquiries. We can quickly give the visitors a good experience, and if we have had a technical error, we have been able to inform the visitors about this, so they are aware of the fact that we have had a problem with the site. Generally, Sleeknote has helped increase our newsletter database, which is really important for a travel agency.</p>



<p>We have increased our database, and at the same time, it is easy and effective to use Sleeknote’s system.</p>



<p>This is an example of Hideaways’ SleekBox on their website:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="705" height="378" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox.png" alt="hideaways sleekbox" class="wp-image-94803" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox.png 705w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-300x161.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-380x204.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-600x322.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-65x35.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-93x50.png 93w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-220x118.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hideaways-sleekbox-385x206.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Is Email Marketing Important for Hideaways?</h2>



<p>It is important for a travel agency to have a lot of good sign-ups for a newsletter, because the fact is, that a newsletter proves to be very efficient in the travel industry. In addition, our whole concept and brand are built on communication – and the way we can communicate with our customers is by knowing their names and e-mail addresses. It will always be valuable to have an e-mail database. So it is like saying: once you have them, it is a relatively inexpensive way to get customer data.</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec25c2d51c5f" class="block-testimonial">

        &#8220;I have already recommended Sleeknote to others. We are certainly satisfied!&#8221;    </blockquote>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>It has been good. I think that the support has been really good – they are open to suggestions, and it seems like they are ready for development and to try new things. Errors are corrected quickly, and they are receptive to new proposals. They improve the system with new features, and it is nice that you can see statistics on your SleekBoxes.</p>

<h2>Why Did You Choose to Use Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>We chose Sleeknote because we already had a hard-coded lead generating software on our website back then, which did just about the same thing as Sleeknote – but when Sleeknote showed up, it was clear, that Sleeknote had a much higher ability and flexibility. We deleted our own software and implemented Sleeknote instead of across all five bureaus within the organization. So basically, we chose Sleeknote because it was more flexible and had several functions in the pipeline.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Do You Use Sleeknote for Today?</h2>



<p>We use Sleeknote both for getting permissions for our newsletter, collect leads to send off custom made holiday offers to (these leads are being handled by our salesforce) and to get followers on the social media. Besides that, we use the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank"> exit intent feature</a> to promote competition, which results in one of the three above conversions.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Collecting Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>Here’s an example of a SleekBox on Højmark’s website:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>We have increased the number of offers we send out to customers with 1,000 – we sent out 1,300 custom made offers last season and this season we have sent out 2,300.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>That will have to be the statistics. Both because it is very similar to the other marketing tools out there, but also, because you can monitor all the data you get – you can go back in time, monitor certain dates and measure performance over an extended period.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>No remarks, really. You periodically receive great emails with good content, and the Customer Success Team is always ready if you struggle with anything.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>STS Alpresor wanted to find a more effective way to increase their conversion rate, as the traditional lead generation methods did not work well for them.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Lead Generation</h2>



<p>We noted that the collection of leads through more traditional methods did not work so well, so we had to find other ways to increase our conversion rate on our traffic lead generation.</p>



<p>Sleeknote has helped us to increase our lead generation dramatically compared to our previous methods.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of how STS Alpresor uses SleekBoxes on their Swedish website sportresor.se</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="532" height="328" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX.png" alt="stsalpresor SLEEKBOX" class="wp-image-94644" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX.png 532w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-300x185.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-380x234.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-57x35.png 57w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-81x50.png 81w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-220x136.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/stsalpresor-SLEEKBOX-385x237.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is the Result of Using Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Fantastic! We have increased our lead generating up to 1000% since we went live with Sleeknote, so we are of course very happy with the results – especially since collecting leads through third-party suppliers is very expensive, and because you can expect a much higher quality from sign up’s from your own site.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Is Email Marketing Important for STS Alpresor?</h2>



<p>The purchase cycle for kind of product we sell is up to 4 weeks, so email marketing is a very important and powerful marketing activity for us, because we have to stay top of mind in our customers’ mind set. It is also the most effective way to communicate with our most loyal customers.</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec257fc734ec" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        “STS Alpresor has engaged Sleeknote mainly for services in lead generation, and we have seen a significant increase as a result of a successful partnership and service. We strongly recommend Sleeknote to future assignments in lead generation.”    </blockquote>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>Very good! There has been a quick and helpful support. We are overall very satisfied with Sleeknote – not only with the results but also with the professional and service-oriented approach towards us.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>Take Offer uses Sleeknote for a variety of different things, such as promoting content, run competitions and collect leads. Especially their advent competition was incredibly successful.</p>



<p>They decided to use Sleeknote because back in 2015, Take Offer launched a new website and they were looking for a tool to help optimize the customer experience.</p>



<p>They wanted to use a range of different messages from soft messages to more sales-oriented messages. At the same time, Take Offer also launched a travel inspiration site with free travel guides and articles.</p>



<p>Take Offer wanted to strengthen their brand and wanted customers to discover and learn about them. The new site is modern and user-friendly and everything is designed from scratch. So they were looking for a tool that offered personalization possibilities especially in terms of the message, shape, form, and functionalities.</p>



<p>Sleeknote provided these opportunities and Sleeknote also cooperate with HeyLoyalty, Take Offer’s ESP, which made the processes way easier.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Lead Collection Through Competition</h3>



<p>Take Offer collected 12,374 leads with a pre-sign-up advent competition and with a conversion of 20.1% that’s a very successful SleekBox.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Here’s Take Offers own take on why the competition worked so well for them:</p>



<p>First of all, there are the many possibilities of creating a completely personalized message. In our experience, the easiest way to gain leads is to provide a short, clear message that states the value for the consumer and what they will gain by giving you the permission to send them emails. That’s sort of the basics of our strategy when creating a lead generating SleekBox.</p>



<p>In this case, with our advent competition, we could also use the Christmas branding we’ve used in the last five years and build on top of that. By reusing some content or ideas, you don’t have to invent something new every year, you save time and gain the advantage of recognizability and that’s a big part of our strategy.</p>

<h3>2. Promoting Content</h3>



<p>Take Offer also uses SleekBoxes for other than lead generating purposes. For instance, to guide their customers to other pages or new features. It’s important for them to be able to mix the messages and find a good balance between sales, promotion, and soft messages like free travel guides, quizzes but also social proof like ‘Did you know that Take Offer helps 40.000 travelers to find their dream destination every year?’</p>



<p>Ida Gall’s favorite thing about Sleeknote is the interface. She finds it’s extremely easy to use and when you create a lot of SleekBoxes and like to test a lot of messages it will save you a lot of time using a system that is so user-friendly.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Oberlo wanted to promote their valuable content to site visitors and collect relevant email leads. To do that, they needed a tool that offered full customization and advanced triggers that would enable them to target individual visitors with the right message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oberlo didn’t have these options with their previous popup tool, but once they tested Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right tool.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Turning Visitors into Quality Email Leads</h2>



<p>Oberlo provides access to a large number of eBooks, hubs, and online courses, and they wanted to use this content to build a relevant email list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One campaign offers a free eBook in exchange for an email address:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup features an illustration of the eBook, which makes it possible for visitors to visualize the value of what they’re getting.</p>



<p>This popup triggers after visitors have been on the site for 10 seconds or if a visitor is about to leave the site. This ensures a better user experience,&nbsp; as visitors get a chance to view the content of the page before getting the offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining a timed trigger with an exit-intent trigger, Oberlo ensures that every visitor gets a chance to download the eBook before they leave the site.</p>



<p>With this specific campaign, Oberlo collected more than 5,000 unique leads in just 6 days.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec272538bb74" class="block-testimonial">

            <span class="customer-title">Email Marketing Manager</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Oberlo has also excluded existing subscribers from seeing this popup, as these people have already given their email address once.</p>



<p>Lastly, Oberlo has excluded this popup from showing on their other eBook pages where the call-to-action is different, making sure that it only appears when it’s relevant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>From Visitor to Subscriber</h2>



<p>Oberlo also uses Sleeknote to collect newsletter permissions on their individual eBook pages:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif" alt="Oberlo-Ebook" class="wp-image-95462" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-300x169.gif 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-768x432.gif 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-380x214.gif 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-600x338.gif 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-760x428.gif 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-62x35.gif 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-89x50.gif 89w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-740x416.gif 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-220x124.gif 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-385x217.gif 385w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup is triggered with javascript, meaning it doesn’t show unless visitors click the “Download” button.</p>



<p>When visitors click the “Download” button, they don’t know they have to enter their name and email address. And yet, 96.92% of the visitors who did decided to follow-through and provide their details in exchange for the eBook.</p>



<p>That’s impressive, and it’s among the highest conversion rates we’ve ever seen for a campaign like this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails that Oberlo collects are segmented into different email lists based on what kind of eBook they have downloaded. By segmenting leads, Oberlo ensures that leads enter the most relevant email onboarding flow.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A/B Testing to Find the Best Performing Popup</h2>



<p>To ensure that their campaigns are always optimized, Oberlo does a lot of A/B testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They recently created an A/B test to see if a top bar without an eBook offer would outperform their slide-in with the eBook offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the top bar:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="56" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-1024x56.png" alt="top bar" class="wp-image-95470" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-1024x56.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-300x17.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-768x42.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-380x21.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-600x33.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-760x42.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-180x10.png 180w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-250x14.png 250w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-740x41.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-220x12.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-385x21.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar.png 1088w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And the slide-in:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<p>The results showed that the slide-in with the eBook offer performed 2000% better than the bar, underlining how important it is to offer an incentive in your popups.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>Siva’s favorite Sleeknote feature is the teaser.</p>



<p>The teaser is a small bar that shows at the bottom of the screen when your popup has yet to be triggered or after it’s been closed. On mobile, the teaser will show first and the popup will only trigger if a visitor clicks to learn more.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec272728bb75" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        “I strongly believe that the teaser is one of the reasons we have such a high conversion rate on our campaigns. It’s a great way to tease the content of the popup in a non-intrusive way. It just works.”    </blockquote>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Oberlo collects between 1,000-5,000 leads with each email popup they set live. They’ve understood how to combine intelligent triggers and conditions to target visitors at the right time with the right message and improve the customer journey.</p>



<p>In just one year, Oberlo has collected more than 39,500 leads for their email marketing.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Knowing how important it is to have a relevant email list packed with relevant prospects, Bolia needed to collect high quality leads for their email list.</p>



<p>With the vast amount of traffic they’re getting to their different sites, Bolia knew they could turn visitors into quality leads with the right popup tool. And after testing Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right solution.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>

<p>Bolia wanted to experiment with the timing of the popup and decided to try a 15-second timer, meaning the popup will only show to visitors who have been on a page for more than 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though 15 seconds might seem like a long time, waiting longer to show the popup created a better user experience. This is because it gave visitors a chance to see the Bolia collection before deciding whether or not to join the newsletter.</p>



<p>Like many online retailers, Bolia also informs visitors about cookies on their site. They needed to make sure the popup wouldn’t show until visitors had accepted cookies, so they added a condition to ensure that their newsletter popup only shows after a visitor has accepted cookies.</p>



<p>By testing the timing of their popup, Bolia found an effective formula to turn site visitors into email leads. This newsletter campaign had a conversion rate of 7.2%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Multiple Platforms</h2>



<p>Bolia also uses competitions to build its email list. To ensure a high-quality customer journey on both desktop and mobile, Bolia creates desktop- and mobile-specific campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They started to experiment with images and the amount of text in their desktop vs. mobile popups. Bolia found that their desktop popups perform better when they include images and details on what visitors get when they enter the competition and sign up for the Bolia newsletter.</p>

<p>On mobile, Bolia found that removing images and using less text created a more user-friendly mobile popup. By doing so, they ensure that the popup doesn’t take up too much screen space on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Bolia also knows how important it is to adapt the messages to their different audiences. They’ve found that offering a 10% discount in France and the Netherlands in exchange for an email is extremely effective, whereas competitions are more effective for their Danish audience. (The French and Dutch campaigns’ conversion rates are 13.46% and 10.45% respectively.)</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Design</h2>



<p>Another feature Bolia takes advantage of is A/B testing. In one experiment, Bolia tested its mobile teaser’s background color on its German mobile popups. One version was blue and the other was orange.</p>

<p>In English, the text reads: Win designs from our new collection.</p>



<p>The orange teaser performed 327% better than the blue teaser. On desktop though, the results were reversed. The blue color outperformed the orange teaser, which goes to show how important it is to test on mobile and desktop separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difference could also be a result of the fact that the desktop version includes product images that go better with the blue color than the orange.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Roede needed a simple and flexible tool to inform visitors and customers about new products and other new initiatives. They also needed to build a strong email list of potential customers for their email marketing.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>



<p>Roede uses Sleeknote to communicate new offers to new visitors. One of these offers is a new course called Kickstart that Roede wanted to promote. They created a simple campaign to inform visitors of the new course.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign has a conversion rate of 44.17%. That means almost half the people who see this campaign click through to read more about the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s not all. This campaign also reduced the amount of questions Roede’s customer service would get about the new course, freeing up more time for other support inquiries.</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Offer of the Week</h2>



<p>Roede also runs a campaign called “Ukens Tilbud” (“Offer of the Week”), where they promote a new product every week.</p>



<p>One of their best-performing offers included a 10% discount on an electric bicycle:</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Out of those who saw this campaign, 5.2% of visitors clicked through to the product page for the electric bike.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>One of Kjetil’s favorite Sleeknote features is the Specific URL condition. He knows how important it is to target the right visitors with the right messages. With the URL condition, Roede ensures that certain campaigns are only shown on relevant pages.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-background" style="background-color:#f5f5f5"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Pro Tip</h2>



<p>Kjetil always visits the website in incognito mode when activating new campaigns on the site. That way he can quickly check if their campaigns targeting new visitors show in the right places at the right time.</p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Kjetil also likes Sleeknote’s direct integration with Mailchimp.</p>

<h2>How to Capitalize On a Growing Market</h2>



<p>Over the past decades, global car sales have been steadily increasing, with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/200002/international-car-sales-since-1990/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forecast</a> for 2018 placing sales at 81.5 million. As a growing market, it presents many opportunities for car manufacturers to sell more than ever before, provided they find a way to stand out from the competition.</p>



<p>Alex Backer, Toyota Denmark’s Digital Marketing Manager, chose to focus on improving their website’s conversions. For them, the three ways to do this were by booking test drives, getting trade-in leads for used cars and converting visitors to newsletter subscribers.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Booking Test Drives</h2>



<p>Test drives are one of the most important conversions Toyota can achieve through their website, as Alex explained it: “Test drives are the closest we can get to a success. We know that out of the people who test our cars, about half end up buying them.”</p>



<p>To convince visitors to book a test drive, Alex made it simple and relevant by creating a “Book a Test Drive” campaign, specific to different cars on their site.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="296" height="315" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1.png" alt="ToyotaSleekBox1" class="wp-image-95362" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1.png 296w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1-282x300.png 282w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1-33x35.png 33w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1-47x50.png 47w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox1-220x234.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Using these campaigns, Toyota Denmark increased their test drive bookings by 27%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Getting Trade-In Leads</h2>



<p>Another way Toyota increased sales was through trade-in leads since many of the people who sold their car to Toyota made a new purchase from them. “About 17% of the trade-in leads turn into sales,” Alex told me. “These generate two-thirds of our conversions and are some of the best leads we get!”</p>



<p>Using Sleeknote, they created a “Get a Quote” form for visitors who were likely interested. Making the form page-specific ensured that it wouldn’t appear for visitors who were only browsing Toyota’s car lineup.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="357" height="369" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1.png" alt="ToyotaSleekBox2-1" class="wp-image-95366" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1.png 357w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-290x300.png 290w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-34x35.png 34w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-48x50.png 48w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-220x227.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>For Toyota Denmark, the concept of “trade-in leads” was created through this campaign. Previously, visitors would go to the dealerships and ask for a quote on their used cars, which required effort and time. The added convenience of filling in the form directly on Toyota’s website made the process easier for the visitors, while generating valuable leads for the company.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Generating Leads Under the GDPR</h2>



<p>Aware that the EU General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GDPR</a>) changed policies regarding data and privacy, Toyota decided to implement a double opt-in process for their email newsletter. The added step required to complete a signup left Alex facing a new issue: “We needed a place on our website where we could motivate visitors to give us their permission.”</p>



<p>Their solution was creating a “Wheel of Fortune” landing page, where visitors would have to complete the double opt-in to spin it. Alex then used a SleekBox to guide website visitors to that page.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="558" height="298" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3.png" alt="ToyotaSleekBox3" class="wp-image-95370" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3.png 558w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-300x160.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-380x203.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-66x35.png 66w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-94x50.png 94w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-220x117.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ToyotaSleekBox3-385x206.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This SleekBox converted at 40.3%. 95% of the newsletter signups gained completed the double opt-in process. This is far above the global average of <a href="https://www.clickz.com/when-should-you-use-confirmed-opt-in/109681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">70-80%</a>.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Toyota Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>The main reason for choosing Sleeknote was our single implementation code. Once active on the website, it allowed Toyota to add campaigns to any of their pages without additional code.</p>



<p>This was especially important for Alex, as he didn’t have direct access to their CMS system. “Any change I want to make needs to go through our main office. And that’s a really slow process,” he explained. “I have used other systems and ran into the same issues. I always needed to integrate the embedded code into the website code on every specific page, so I had to get a developer to put in the code. With Sleeknote I can simply pick and choose the pages I want to have it on.”</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Toyota manages to thrive in their market by continuously innovating and improving the ways they leverage their resources. Identifying the key conversions on their websites, such as the test drives, trade-ins, and newsletter permissions allowed them to focus their efforts on improving the parts of their customer journey that matter most.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>Lakrids needed a smart and effective way to get more signups for their newsletter. They needed a tool that&nbsp; was integratable with Mailchimp, easy to implement and worked with Shopify. Sleeknote met all the criterias and more.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Increase Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>We were looking for a smart and effective way to get more signups for our newsletter. We knew that slide-ins and popups were a great way to capture leads, so we started looking for a tool that could do this. The main criteria for the tool was that it was integratable with Mailchimp, easy to implement and worked with Shopify. Sleeknote met all the criteria and more.</p>



<p>Today, our main purpose with Sleeknote is still to get signups for our newsletter. It’s important to us that we only send emails to people who actually want them, and by using Sleeknote we ensure this, as people voluntarily enter their email in our SleekBoxes.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Guiding Customers</h3>



<p>We also use Sleeknote for service messages. Once, some of our shipments to Germany were delayed due to a heatwave. To avoid doubt and a high number of calls to our customer service, we created a SleekBox informing people of the situation.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec2705c15d98" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;We released our Swedish website a month ago, and the sleeknote on this site has a conversion rate of 11,2 % and has already collected more than 200 signups.&#8221;    </blockquote>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>We’ve noticed a huge difference in the number of signups before and after we started using Sleeknote.</p>



<p>We released our Swedish website a month ago, and the SleekBox on this site has a conversion rate of 11,2 % and has already collected more than 200 signups.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Function or Option?</h2>



<p>I don’t know if it’s a feature or not, but I love the fact that you can put an image on the SleekBox, as it makes it way easier to make the SleekBox fit the layout of the website, which is very important to us. Besides that, I also love how user-friendly the editor is.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Describe Sleeknote with 3 Words</h2>



<p>User-friendly, easy and relevant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Think about what you want to achieve with Sleeknote; More signups, more social followers, promotion or something else?</p>



<p>Give it a try and test what works and what doesn’t. Remember to design your SleekBox so it matches the layout of your website. Then your visitors won’t see it as an “external” popup, but more like a part of your website.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>I’ve actually never needed to talk with your support as your dashboard is so user-friendly.</p>

<h2>Why Apuls Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Apuls faced a problem that many online businesses face today:</p>



<p>They weren’t getting enough information from the people who signed up for their newsletter.</p>



<p>They knew that getting an email address wasn’t enough. Like most companies, they wanted to learn more about their subscribers so they could personalize their email campaigns and increase their email ROI.</p>



<p>Apuls also wanted to provide visitors with relevant information based on their behavior on the site, such as product recommendations, customer service messages, special deals, and so on.</p>



<p>They couldn’t do this with their solution at the time and started looking for a more customizable software to help solve these problems.</p>



<p>Once they found Sleeknote, Casper quickly saw how easy it was to create customized campaigns targeted at individual visitors.</p>

            <span class="customer-name">Casper Hesselund</span>
            <span class="customer-title">Chief Marketing Officer</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Like many marketers, Casper was afraid that implementing popup campaigns on their site would hurt the user experience. But these concerns disappeared when he saw how he could target individual visitors with just the right information at the right time—without annoying visitors.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Apuls Generates Leads</h2>



<ul><li>Email marketing is an important channel for Apuls. They wanted to create highly segmented email campaigns based on their subscribers’ interests.</li></ul>



<p>But to do so, they needed a tool to help them get information from subscribers that could be used to automate their email marketing.</p>



<p>After trying Sleeknote, Apuls found out that a multistep campaign was the perfect solution for this.</p>



<p>With a multistep campaign, Apuls can ask visitors about their interests upon signup so they get the information right away and don’t have to follow up with email surveys.</p>



<p>Here’s one of the multistep campaigns Apuls uses:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="854" height="480" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1.gif" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95274"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>They know that a visitor who’s interested in say, running equipment, should get running-related email campaigns promoting relevant offers like running gear, supplements, etc.</p>



<p>Knowing the interest of their subscribers enables Apuls to automate a lot of their email marketing while keeping the content relevant to the individual subscriber.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Two Intelligent Ways of Using Exit-Intent</h2>



<p>Apuls has also experimented a lot with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank">Exit-Intent</a> on their site and found two highly effective use cases.</p>



<p>First, Apuls uses an exit-intent campaign to engage abandoning visitors who haven’t added products to their cart. They encourage abandoning visitors to join their exclusive newsletter with new products and great offers.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>Apuls wants visitors to stay on their site as long as possible but know that getting a visitor’s email address is more valuable at this point. With an email address, they can create targeted email campaigns for the user and turn them into repeat customers instead of one-time buyers.</p>



<p>They also use an exit-intent campaign in their cart to reduce cart abandonment. They offer a discount code to encourage users to return to their cart and finish the purchase.</p>

<h2>How Apuls Helps Visitors Find the Right Products</h2>



<p>At Apuls, there’s a great focus on providing visitors with the best possible experience. They want to give visitors the same personal guidance you would find in any physical store.</p>



<p>They also realize that with a large product variety, it can be difficult for visitors to find the right product based on their needs.</p>



<p>Apuls uses Sleeknote to help visitors find what they’re looking for with relevant product recommendations based on the product categories they browse.</p>



<p>For example, if a visitor looks at running machines, Apuls shows a campaign with recommendations for running machines in different price ranges so visitors can easily see which machine fits their need and budget.</p>

<p>After implementing segmented campaigns like this on their site, Apuls has seen a significant increase in conversion rates and sales.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Switching From DIY to Managed Solution</h2>



<p>When Apuls first started using Sleeknote, they created and managed campaigns on their own.</p>



<p>When they found out that Sleeknote offers a managed solution—a bespoke done-for-you service—they quickly jumped at this opportunity.</p>



<p>As Casper put it:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/r1t13fjl8l.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_r1t13fjl8l" style="height:360px;position:relative;width:640px"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/r1t13fjl8l/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;"></div></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The switch to managed solution meant that Casper and the rest of the Apuls team now have more time to work on their company mission: giving people the tools and information they need to exercise more and live a healthy active lifestyle.</p>

<p>With the managed solution, Apuls can rest assured that their campaigns are constantly being optimized based on data from more than 15 billion sessions. This data also enables the managed solution team to make data-driven decisions and come up with new ideas.</p>



<p>To begin with, Apuls chose the Essential plan which is the most affordable plan.</p>



<p>In Casper’s words,</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Best Performing Campaigns</h2>



<p>Apuls has great success with their product recommendation campaigns.</p>



<p>One of the best performing campaigns is a campaign on their bicycle product page where they recommend three different bicycles.</p>

<p>Apuls knows that their visitors are at different training levels. So, with that in mind, they showcase a “beginner bike” for those who’re just getting started with cycling and have a smaller budget.</p>



<p>Then, they show a “medium bike” for the more experienced who are looking to take their training to a new level and invest in a bike with more features. The last bike Apuls recommends is a high-performance bike for visitors who want the best of the best.</p>



<p>It can be difficult for visitors to get an overview of the different bikes and decide which one is best for their needs. So by limiting the options and recommending a single bike for each level has proven to be an effective way of helping visitors make that choice.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>The multistep and the countdown timer are two of Casper’s favorite features.</p>



<p>The multistep allows Apuls to get more information from new signups in a very simple and non-intrusive way.</p>



<p>And the countdown timer is used to create urgency in their campaigns. For example, visitors might get a free product if they buy from a specific product category within a certain time frame.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Apuls is experiencing rapid growth and has found a way to personalize their on-site campaigns, email marketing and more to meet the visitor where they are in the customer journey.</p>



<p>Casper has no doubts that personalization is the future of marketing, and if you want to get your audience’s attention and stand out from competitors a simple merge tag isn’t going to cut it.</p>



<p>By implementing Sleeknote on their site, Apuls has been able to take their personalization to a new level which has helped them collect more relevant email addresses for their email marketing, improve the user experience on their site, and increase conversion rates.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>GrejFreak wanted a user-friendly, simple to use tool to increase newsletter subscriptions, target visitors with discount offers and deliver service announcements.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Guiding Visitors</h3>



<p>Our products are not only delivered between Monday and Friday, but also on Saturdays. We activate a SleekBoxThursday evening saying “Make your order today or tomorrow and get your products Saturday”. We did something similar last Christmas with a SleekBox saying “You still have time! Make your order before 23rd of December and receive it before Christmas Eve”. This is just a few of the ways we use Sleeknote to create service announcements.</p>

<h3>2. Increasing Newsletter Subscriptions</h3>



<p>We ask our customers to sign up for our newsletter when they’ve purchased something and we also ask our 30,000 facebook followers to sign up for the newsletter. Still, this doesn’t give many signups compared to when our SleekBoxes are active.</p>



<p>We get twice as many subscribers when the SleekBoxes active than when the they are disabled.</p>



<p>In sale periods we write a newsletter and advertise heavily on facebook. This gives a fair amount of sale, but the moment we activate a SleekBox telling people that we have sales the amount of sale increases a lot.</p>

<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>I don’t know if it’s a feature but the drag-n-drop function in the editor is brilliant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Would You Tell Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>It’s super easy to get started. You’re able to do it all by yourself. The only thing we needed help for was to ensure that the code to implement Sleeknote came in the right place, and it didn’t take more than two minutes. It is by no means complicated.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration With Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>We’ve only had problems a few times, but each time, you have responded fast on the chat or email. I’ve also called you 1 or 2 times, and each time your support responded immediately and solved my problem. I only have positive things to say about your customer service.</p>

<h2>Discount Craze</h2>



<p>BilligParfume’s mission is simple: to offer the same brands and high-quality products as specialized stores—at lower prices. They achieve this through campaigns, special offers, and discounts, giving customers some of the best deals on the market.</p>



<p>Naturally, events like Black Friday are crucial to their strategy. Given the competitive nature of these events, BilligParfume boosts their marketing efforts, using ads and content across various channels to drive traffic to their site. This traffic comes alongside waves of organic visitors, resulting in some of the most customer-packed periods of the year.</p>



<p>Once visitors reach the website, turning them into customers becomes the priority. To do this, the offers need to meet their expectations and the user experience on the site has to be flawless. From promoting the right products to the landing page design, all the elements are carefully crafted to maximize conversions. Then, the only thing left is ensuring that visitors end up on the right landing page.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Enhancing The User Journey</h2>



<p>During their 2017 Black Friday campaign, BilligParfume used the following Guide Your Visitors SleekBox to make accessing the Black Friday page as easy as possible. Using the exit intent trigger, they made sure this campaign was only shown to visitors who were about to leave their website before seeing that page.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="611" height="288" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95166" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7.png 611w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-300x141.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-380x179.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-600x283.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-74x35.png 74w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-106x50.png 106w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-220x104.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-7-385x181.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign converted at 61.3%, taking more than half of the visitors who were about to leave the site to the special offers page. Pernille, BilligParfume’s CEO, told me: “I don’t think that everyone visiting our website that day would have found the right Black Friday page had it not been for Sleeknote.”</p>



<p>They also ran a Singles’ Day campaign that converted at 35.59%. As such, many visitors about to exit the site returned, showing that they were interested in the offers, but couldn’t find them at first glance.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="718" height="594" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5.png" alt="Sleekbox 2" class="wp-image-95170" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5.png 718w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-300x248.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-380x314.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-600x496.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-42x35.png 42w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-60x50.png 60w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-592x490.png 592w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-220x182.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-2-5-385x319.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Furthermore, when they ran special campaigns, like Black Friday and Single’s Day, the visitor-to-customer conversion for those pages was noticeably higher than their average. Through these simple on-site messages, BilligParfume was able to sell to visitors who would have likely left without completing a purchase.</p>



<p>BilligParfume also created a Christmas calendar competition that converted at 30%. Visitors had to subscribe to BilligParfume’s newsletter to participate in daily draws for special prizes. These types of leads convert to customers at a high rate and are an integral part of the company’s marketing strategy.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="635" height="634" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2.png" alt="Sleekbox 3" class="wp-image-95174" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2.png 635w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-300x300.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-380x379.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-600x599.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-35x35.png 35w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-50x50.png 50w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-491x490.png 491w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-220x220.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-385x384.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-3-2-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Lastly, BilligParfume used an exit-intent campaign to reduce cart abandonment. They did this by offering visitors who were about to leave the site a discount code, as shown in the SleekBox below:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="249" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1.png" alt="Sleekbox 4" class="wp-image-95178" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1-300x197.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1-53x35.png 53w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1-76x50.png 76w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-4-1-220x144.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>

<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Through their Guide Your Visitors campaigns, BilligParfume managed to achieve a 61.3% conversion rate for Black Friday, 35.59% conversion rate for Singles’ Day and a 30% signup rate to their newsletter through a Christmas calendar campaign. On top of that, they also reduced their cart abandonment rate through an exit-intent campaign.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Every company has its peak season, whether it’s a month, a quarter or a day. During these times your efforts are scaled up—you invest more in promotions, send out more offers, bring out your best discounts and traffic skyrockets beyond your weekly average. But it’s what happens after visitors get to your site that really matters. Ensuring they experience your promotions the way you intended them to is a crucial final step in their user journey.</p>



<p>BilligParfume’s case is a perfect example of enhancing this journey by making the most relevant pages and offers easily accessible from the start. Furthermore, their conversion rates prove that visitors are looking for those pages and appreciate the convenience added through these Guide Your Visitors shortcuts.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Black Friday 2018</h2>



<p>If you’re unsure of just how important these events are, I have something to show you. The following graph is based on our own data, from current customers. It compares the traffic they get in an average week to the number of visitors during the Black Friday 2018 week:</p>

<p>At its peak, on average, companies see an increase of 130.19% in traffic, from visitors who are more likely to complete a purchase than they would be on an average day. This is a rare opportunity for companies to boost their sales, provided they find a way to capitalize on all this traffic.</p>

<h2>You Have to Run to Stay in Place</h2>



<p>Nordic Race had an extensive online marketing strategy, covering everything from SEO to Facebook and Google Ads, with their yearly growth standing testament to its success. In spite of its effectiveness, the trend of increasing prices for paid online advertising made Jonas Elming, a partner for Nordic Race, consider more cost-effective alternatives.</p>



<p>He found the answer to be email marketing, as it is one of the most cost-effective channels for Nordic Race. For this initiative to succeed, signing up website visitors to their newsletter became a priority. The first step was improving the on-page conversion rate. Furthermore, they also needed to improve the user experience on their site. As Nordic Race offers a complex product, their pages are generally filled with information, which can make navigating the website difficult for newcomers.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Getting Newsletter Subscribers</h2>



<p>Nordic Race’s user journey started with a sign-up form. They chose Sleeknote for its application programming interface (API) with MailChimp and the various triggers “which made sure we didn’t annoy our visitors,” Jonas explained.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Enhancing the Online Experience</h2>



<p>Nordic Race’s website showcases their complex service package in detail. Because of this, the user journey often involves navigating subpages and various menus, which make it difficult to see their call-to-action (CTA).</p>



<p>The solution to this was elegant, as Jonas explained it: “Through Sleeknote, our visitors always have a ‘Buy Now’ option in the corner of the screen. Our conversion rates increased since implementing this.” Furthermore, they also use a SleekBox to offer quick access to their upcoming events’ pages on their home page.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="500" height="370" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1.png" alt="NordicRace_SleekBox2-1" class="wp-image-95124" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1.png 500w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-300x222.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-380x281.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-47x35.png 47w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-68x50.png 68w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-220x163.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox2-1-385x285.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>In addition to CTAs, special offers, news, and promotions can also get lost through the subpages and menus, so Nordic Race implemented a SleekBar at the top of their website featuring their latest offerings.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="784" height="72" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar.png" alt="NordicRace_SleekBar" class="wp-image-95116" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar.png 784w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-300x28.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-768x71.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-380x35.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-600x55.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-760x70.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-180x17.png 180w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-250x23.png 250w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-740x68.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-220x20.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBar-385x35.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Aside from showcasing the latest offerings, this type of SleekBar also ensures returning visitors know that the website is up to date.</p>



<p>“Sixty-five percent of our traffic comes from mobile, therefore we spend a lot of time to make sure that mobile visitors also have a good experience,” Jonas told me. This makes the issue even more complicated, as smaller screens require a different approach to displaying information. Their solution came in the form of the following SleekBox.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="320" height="400" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1.png" alt="NordicRace_SleekBox3-1" class="wp-image-95128" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1.png 320w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1-240x300.png 240w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1-28x35.png 28w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1-40x50.png 40w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NordicRace_SleekBox3-1-220x275.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>“Popups on mobile are more annoying than on desktops, so we keep our mobile campaigns as simple as possible, often using different triggers,” Jonas told me. These triggers ensure that rather than simply taking up screen real estate at all time, Nordic Race’s on-site messages improved the user experience at the right time.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>With the rising prices of online advertising, efficient alternatives such as email marketing have become more relevant. Leveraging traffic you already have is often all it takes to be successful with this channel, as people on your site are already interested in what you offer.</p>



<p>Nordic Race knows this, and by implementing on-site messages they were able to not only gain more email permissions but also improve the on-site experience for new visitors and increase their visitor-to-customer conversion rates.</p>

<h2>Old Issues, New Solutions</h2>



<p>When Camilla Schmidt Nygaard started working as Atea’s Digital Marketing Specialist two years ago, the company was undergoing a digital transformation, aiming to “leave the ‘box movers brand’ behind and become a trusted IT advisor.” As part of this process, they implemented new marketing tools and initiatives to boost their online presence. An important step was ensuring the best possible user experience on their site.</p>



<p>Traditionally, this was done through user surveys, requiring preparation, countless interviews, and analyses. Like many in her position, Camilla did not have the time or resources to conduct these surveys, so she started looking for alternative solutions. “I needed a simple yet reliable way to explore what our website visitors actually feel when they are about to finish their session,” she told me. However, the challenge of conducting surveys on-site was doing it without hurting the overall user experience (UX).</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Atea Gathers Feedback From its Visitors</h2>



<p>Camilla explained that “When you’re working on your website for a long time, you sometimes go blind to obvious things users might be looking for, which can damage the overall UX and hurt your brand.” To assess their visitors’ experience, she introduced a simple form that asked them if they found what they were looking for. If they did not, they could then write down what they were after. What made this campaign special was using the exit-intent trigger, which “does not interrupt the users and lets them go through a natural session,” as Camilla explained it.</p>

<p>This ongoing campaign allows Camilla to tailor the user experience on Atea’s website in a way that makes the most relevant content readily available. Patterns in the feedback show ways they can improve their online customer journey, at times by changing a simple call-to-action, other times by adjusting the information they display at the first glance. Furthermore, they can do all this in close to real time, which allows them to adapt to every small change in the market.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Getting Leads</h2>



<p>Newsletter subscribers turned out to be great sales leads for Atea, which made acquiring them a priority. They approached lead generation in two main ways: (1) targeting special events and (2) offering relevant resources in return for newsletter permissions. Like many IT companies, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the most relevant events to Atea. To make the most of them, they used a two-step campaign. First, they signed visitors up to their newsletter two days before the event, by offering them access to the best Black Friday offers.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="323" height="285" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2.png" alt="Atea-SleekBox2" class="wp-image-95095" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2.png 323w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2-300x265.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2-40x35.png 40w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2-57x50.png 57w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Atea-SleekBox2-220x194.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>These campaigns ran for two days each and generated as many leads as the company usually gets over a two-week period. On the day of the event, they replaced the signup SleekBox with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/guide-your-visitors" target="_blank">Guide Your Visitors</a> campaign, which took new visitors to the Black Friday deals page. Their 2017 Black Friday and Cyber Monday campaigns’ revenue more than doubled compared to 2016, and according to Camilla “Using Sleeknote was definitely a big factor in this success.”</p>

<p>Another way Atea gained newsletter subscribers was by offering relevant resources in exchange for permissions – also known as gated content. They did this by adding SleekBoxes to pages focused on certain topics, and offering access to relevant resources like IT related reports and analyses exclusively to newsletter subscribers.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Camilla explained that “This converts really well because the visitors on those pages are already interested in those areas.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Atea Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Camilla was looking for a tool that would not limit her to one fixed use or purpose, as she needed to be able to experiment with different initiatives. In her case, “The best thing about Sleeknote is its technical and visual flexibility.” When she implemented Sleeknote, her first impression was that “It’s just like everyone says—easy to use, intuitive and flexible. But more than that, we didn’t have to compromise on Atea’s brand, as it blends in as an obvious part of the website.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Impact on Atea</h2>



<p>While we are not at liberty to disclose Atea’s specific numbers, Camilla told me that “Our results are much better now, and the high conversion rates make Sleeknote very reliable.” However, it is important to note that for their use case, specifically gathering user feedback, results go beyond sales and numbers. With this ongoing campaign, they are able to constantly take the pulse of their visitors and adapt their customer journey to the user’s expectations in close to real-time. This surpasses even the traditional method of periodic surveys in both efficiency and effectiveness, allowing them to stay on top of developing market trends and changes.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Different roles and responsibilities have their own unique challenges, and there is no “one size fits all” solution. The creativity of the user needs to be complemented by the flexibility of their tools in order to overcome these challenges. Atea’s use of Sleeknote is a perfect example a creative solution addressing an issue that has been plaguing many Digital Marketers.</p>



<p>There are two ways to define innovation: creating something completely new or combining existing tools and knowledge in a new way. This form of surveying visitors is the latter, trading the depth of traditional surveys for an effective and efficient solution that anyone could implement.</p>

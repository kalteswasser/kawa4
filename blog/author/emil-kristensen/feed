<p><a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/onw/#view/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Statistically speaking</a>, half of this imaginary 10-person sample will head straight for Amazon. But three (or, to be precise, 3.6) of you will <em>google it.</em></p>



<p>Over one-third of all product searches begin on Google. So it’s hardly surprising that Google Shopping Ads account for 76.4 percent of all <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/the-rise-of-google-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">retail search ad spending</a> in the US and 82 percent in the UK.</p>



<p>Google Shopping isn’t just a helpful tool for consumers—it also benefits retailers because when someone clicks one of those juicy product links, they’re sent straight to the advertiser’s <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-shopify-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-commerce store</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re not already advertising on Google Shopping, you’re missing out. And if you are, it pays to wring every last cent from your budget.</p>



<p>Either way, these seven Google Shopping best practices will help you out.</p>

<h2 id="1"><strong>1. Start Small, Then Scale Up</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re new to the world of Google Shopping, the best piece of advice I can offer you is to start out with very low bids until you’ve figured out what you’re doing.</p>



<p>The fact is, you will<em> </em>make mistakes. When you do, they’ll cost you money. So it’s far better to make them when the stakes are low because your bids and budgets are minimal.</p>



<p>There’s another benefit to this approach, too—it forces you to focus on quality over quantity. If you immediately plow a bunch of money into your ads, you’ll almost certainly bring in a ton of traffic but a lot of that traffic won’t convert.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you force yourself to stick to a tight budget, you’ll have to be highly efficient to get eyes on your products. You’ll need to <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/email-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximize click-through rates</a> (CTRs), control your bidding to improve profit margins and reduce bounce rates.</p>



<p>This way, you’ll be bringing in a small but steady stream of quality traffic, not a flash-flood of irrelevant shoppers looking for stuff you don’t even sell.</p>



<p>Once you’ve reached that point, you can turn up the tap by increasing your bids and budgets because you know what you’re doing is effective.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. Nail Your Campaign Structure</strong></h2>



<p>“Campaign structure” is one of the biggest ways you can level up the performance of your Google Shopping campaigns.</p>



<p>Let me explain why structure matters.</p>



<p>The most basic campaign structure would look like this:</p>



<ul><li>1x campaign</li><li>1x ad group</li><li>1x product group</li></ul>



<p>But there’s a problem with this approach. Because there’s just a solitary product group, you’re bidding exactly the same amount for every click—no matter the search query or product.</p>



<p>You might be happy paying €1+ per click for high-ticket items like my beloved Rolex, but what if your imaginary watch emporium also sells low-price products, like those springy bars that attach the strap to the lug? (Yes, “lug” is the right word, I googled it.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>They only cost a couple of euros, so your bids need to be a lot lower, otherwise, you’ll lose money with every click.</p>



<p>Clearly, it doesn’t make sense to have one bid for all product types. So you need to build multiple product groups, based on criteria like:</p>



<ul><li>Brand;</li><li>Product type; and</li><li>Item ID.</li></ul>



<p>The next step is to use custom labels to factor in more granular information.</p>



<p>Now, you’re in a world where you can set different bid levels based on factors like sales volume and profit margin. So if you sell two types of watch strap spring bar at €3 apiece, but one makes you a profit of €2 and the other only makes you €1.50, you can set your bids accordingly.</p>



<p>As a general rule, if you’re not sure how to structure your campaigns, you’re best off replicating the structure of your e-commerce store, with different campaigns for different <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-category-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product categories</a>, subcategories, and brands.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. Optimize Your Product Imagery</strong></h2>



<p>Google relies on the imagery provided by retailers to populate its shopping adverts.</p>



<p>If your imagery isn’t up to scratch, people aren’t going to click your ads. What’s more, Google understands shoppers want to see quality imagery, so it actively <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6142776?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blocks campaigns</a> if the visuals aren’t good enough.</p>



<p>Meaning, you need to improve the standard of your product imagery before you’re ready to start advertising on Google Shopping.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Google is crystal clear about how it wants your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-photography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product photos</a> to look. Images should:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Be set against a solid, light-colored background.</strong> White or light gray are best.</li><li><strong>Be clearly and evenly lit.</strong> Google Shopping is no place for artsy lighting.</li><li><strong>Show the product at the right scale. </strong>It shouldn’t be too big or too small, and should take up 75-90 percent of the full image.</li><li><strong>Not be overly edited. </strong>Steer clear of blurring, pixelation, and vignetting your imagery. It might look pretty, but it doesn’t help shoppers get a clear view of the product.</li><li><strong>Clearly depict the product being sold. </strong>Close-ups and rear views are fine as supplementary images but don’t use them as the main image.</li></ul>



<p>Beyond these specific rules, there are a few other best practices you should follow with your product imagery where relevant:</p>



<ul><li>Try to show off clothing products on-body;</li><li>Provide multiple angles; and</li><li>Depict real people wearing or using it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Use Negative Keywords</strong></h2>



<p>Every time someone clicks your Google Shopping Ads, it costs you money. So the last thing you want is for some of those clicks to be wasted on people who weren’t even looking for the product you’re selling.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to my Rolex example. (Maybe if I mention them enough times, they’ll send me a free one.)</p>



<p>Say, your e-commerce store exclusively sells brand new Yacht-Master watches. That means you definitely wouldn’t want your Shopping ads to show up on searches like:</p>



<ul><li>Used Rolex Yacht-Master</li><li>Refurbished Rolex Yacht-Master</li><li>Second-hand Rolex Yacht-Master</li></ul>



<p>You might also want to steer clear of terms like “cheap Rolex Yacht-Master” or “Rolex Yacht-Master deals”, plus comparison searches such as “Rolex Yacht-Master alternatives”.</p>



<p>If you’re only targeting the term “Rolex Yacht-Master”, you could appear in every one of those searches, despite them being irrelevant to your store.</p>



<p>The solution? <em>Negative keywords.</em></p>



<p>Trawl through your search terms report and look out for the following types of <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/keyword-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keywords</a> to exclude:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Competitor terms: </strong>Branded queries incorporating your competitors’ names. It can be tempting to bid on rival brands, but it’s often expensive and rarely effective.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Irrelevant terms: </strong>You don’t want to be bidding on queries for products you don’t sell, or for things that aren’t even products.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extremely generic terms: </strong>Sure, you sell watches. But your Rolex store is unlikely to generate a lot of sales from people searching the term “watches”.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Out-of-stock or unlaunched products: </strong>If you don’t have the Yacht-Master 42 in stock, there’s no point bidding for it.</li></ul>



<p>Purge your account of terms like these by adding them as negative keywords, then you can expect to see healthy upticks in CTR, conversion rate, and return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. Monitor for Product Overlap</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s say your e-commerce store doesn’t exclusively sell Rolex Yacht-Master watches and accessories. You sell other Rolexes, too, plus products from a bunch of other watchmakers.</p>



<p>In that case, you could be running dozens, or even hundreds, of different campaigns simultaneously. This means there’s a good chance some of your products are appearing in multiple campaigns. That’s bad news and here’s why.</p>



<p>Say, you have a product that appears in two different campaigns:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Campaign one</strong> has a ROAS target of 500 percent</li><li><strong>Campaign two</strong> has a ROAS target of 1,000 percent</li></ul>



<p>Suddenly, you’re bidding against yourself and because Google settles for the lower<em> </em>target, <strong>campaign two</strong> is going to beat <strong>campaign one </strong>for that duplicated product. As a result, you’ll make less money.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Craft Engaging Product Titles</strong></h2>



<p>As I’ve already noted, imagery is extremely important to the performance of your Google Shopping Ads. <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/pricing-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pricing</a> is another crucial factor—if you’re selling the same product as someone else but at twice the price, good luck winning those clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s one more element that’s too important to ignore: your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product titles</a>.</p>



<p>The more relevant and engaging your titles, the higher your CTR will be, and the better your campaign will perform. But how do you tell if your product titles are <em>good?</em></p>



<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to guess. <a href="https://www.storegrowers.com/product-title-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Store Growers</a>, a specialist in <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/how-to-use-google-adwords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Ads for e-commerce</a>, analyzed 151 product titles from 120 different advertisers across 13 industries, and identified the following best practices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep product titles to the optimal length. </strong>Google allows titles of up to 150 characters, but sticking to 75-100 characters works best.</li><li><strong>Write numbers as digits. </strong>Write “7” instead of “seven”. 97 percent of top advertisers do this.</li><li><strong>Capitalize product titles. </strong>97 percent of top advertisers use this technique.</li><li><strong>Use symbols for ease of reading. </strong>70 percent of top advertisers use symbols like hyphens (-), forward slashes (/), vertical lines (|), and commas (,) to make product titles easier to digest.</li><li><strong>Add extra (relevant) keywords. </strong>This tip is used by 32 percent of top advertisers.</li><li><strong>Include your brand name. </strong>This one’s most relevant to brands, rather than retailers that stock a range of brands. Still, 44 percent of top advertisers do it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="7"><strong>7. Ditch Unprofitable Keywords</strong></h2>



<p>The Pareto Principle—otherwise known as the 80/20 Rule—declares that most things in life aren’t distributed evenly.</p>



<p>Esteemed economist <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/80-20-rule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vilfredo Pareto</a> formulated his principle from the observation that 80 percent of land in Italy was owned by 20 percent of the population.</p>



<p>But it applies to a lot of other things, too.</p>



<p>In the context of Google Shopping, you’ll likely notice that a small subset of keywords is driving a high proportion of your returns. It’s in your interest to trawl through your account, identify the biggest “losers”, and mark them as excluded.</p>



<p>There are lots of reasons why you might want to exclude a certain keyword. For instance:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It’s out of season: </strong>You’re not going to sell a lot of chunky parkas at the height of summer.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>It’s out of stock: </strong>If you don’t have it, you can’t sell it.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>It’s only available in obscure sizes or colors: </strong>If you’ve only got a t-shirt left in XXXL with a hot pink colorway, it might be time to exclude that keyword.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>A lot of experts like to make Google Shopping sound extremely complicated, but it really isn’t rocket science.</p>



<p>Sure, there are some technical elements and complex terminology to get your head around. But once you’ve done that, getting it right is mostly a case of sticking to core <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-marketing-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing principles</a>.</p>



<p>Showcase your product effectively through words and images. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot by cannibalizing your own campaigns. Identify the activity that’s driving the best results, learn from it, and roll it out across the rest of your ad and product groups.</p>



<p>Keep doing the simple stuff and over time you’ll see a big enough return to afford your own Rolex Yacht-Master.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Build a B2B Sales Process?</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve been in sales long enough, you’ve probably heard of that salesperson who closes leads without trying. The person who understands every lead’s problem and can present convincing marketing messages.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is an exception rather than the rule. In reality, B2B sales reps need to be more of scientists than artists to sell effectively. Meaning, they need to have a B2B sales process rather than winging it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to research by Vantage Point Performance and the Sales Management Association, companies with a defined sales process <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/companies-with-a-formal-sales-process-generate-more-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deliver an 18 percent higher revenue growth</a> than companies without a sales process.</p>



<p>One major benefit of having a B2B sales process is that it provides a sense of direction to your salespeople. They can see an overview of the stages of turning a lead into a customer.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a sales process makes it easy to identify and block leakages in the <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-sales-funnel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales funnel</a>. Likewise, if you run a sales team, you can track your sales reps’ effectiveness at different stages of the process.</p>



<p>With proper documentation over a period, your team can also make more accurate sales forecasts from the number of prospects at a particular stage in the sales process.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, your B2B sales process shouldn’t be too rigid if you want to obtain these benefits. Rather, they should be adaptable according to industries, pain points, and other factors.</p>



<p>Now, let’s go over the vital stages of a B2B sales process.</p>



<h2 id="1"><strong>1. Acquire Sales Qualified Leads</strong></h2>



<p>Businesses often expect salespeople to perform miracles without considering the quality of leads they have to work with. For instance, MarketingSherpa found in a study that <a href="https://sherpablog.marketingsherpa.com/b2b-marketing/lead-gen/b2b-funnel-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">61 percent of B2B marketers send all leads</a> to sales. Out of those leads, only 27 percent are qualified.</p>



<p>In such situations, sales reps face an uphill battle to turn their leads into customers. That’s why acquiring sales <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/lead-qualification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">qualified leads</a> should be the first step in your B2B sales process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your sales and marketing teams need to determine the criteria for a sales qualified lead together. What are the actions a lead must take to show they have a high chance of buying your product or service?</p>



<p>Once a lead is sales qualified, the sales team can acquire information about the lead and their past interactions with the marketing team. This is where a CRM tool comes in handy. For teams that use a CRM tool, collaboration and transfer of information about leads are usually seamless.</p>



<p>Acquiring sales qualified leads is beneficial for one primary reason: it will prevent you from wasting energy and time on leads that are less likely to buy your product.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. Understand Your Prospect’s Business</strong></h2>



<p>If a business has to pay $5,000 for a product that’s critical to their operations, they want you to, at least, understand their needs. You can also call this the <em>discovery</em> stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, you need to check their website and understand:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Their services;</li><li>The type of customers they serve;</li><li>Their brand voice; and</li><li>Pain points your product can eliminate.</li></ul>



<p>Apart from these, you need to know the decision-makers involved in purchasing your product. In most cases, the decision-makers will be potential users and the department related to your product.</p>



<p>Next, you should study their industry and some of their competitors. Can your product give them an edge over their competitors? Make sure to capitalize on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, there are some details about your prospects that you can only have when you ask. It’s important to directly ask those questions that can reveal their pain points.</p>



<p>This makes prospects feel important. In fact, in a HubSpot study, buyers think the most important way sales representatives can improve the sales experience is by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/buyers-speak-out-how-sales-needs-to-evolve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listening to their needs</a>.</p>

<p>By performing these tasks, you can develop personalized solutions to their pain points.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. Educate Prospects About Their Business</strong></h2>



<p>When you research your prospect’s business, most of the information you’ll find is what your prospect already knows. Now, what insights did you draw from <em>your</em> knowledge of <em>their</em> business?</p>



<p>You need to fill this information gap so that prospects can see a glimpse of the benefits they’ll derive from your product.</p>



<p>While interacting with your leads, deliver unique insights you’ve acquired from your research into their business and industry. At this point, you can provide information about common problems they face and possible ways your product is a viable solution.</p>



<p>Educating your prospects about their business shows that you’ve done your homework. Better still, you’re likely to impress a prospect because they’re already obtaining value even when there’s no contract in place.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.singlegrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Single Grain</a> has a great example of this. The marketing agency provides free marketing consultation on their website.</p>

<p>During this consultation, they ask critical questions about your business’s marketing campaigns. In return, they provide insights and how Single Grain can help you improve your marketing results.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Make Your Sales Pitch</strong></h2>



<p>In most cases, after extensive research, B2B prospects already have an idea of what your product can offer. Nevertheless, you need to convince them with a personalized <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/b2b-sales-pitch-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales pitch</a>.</p>



<p>This could be through an email, phone call, or video call. During this pitch, you have to present your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-value-proposition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique selling proposition</a> and how it will eliminate their pain points.</p>



<p>You should also show how your product will improve prospects’ revenue. You can base this estimate on the results similar businesses got by using your product.</p>



<p>Remember to keep your sales pitch as short as possible. If you’re pitching on a call, two minutes is a good number. You can then have a few minutes to take questions.</p>



<p>What if you get no reply to your email sales pitch? You can send a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/follow-up-emails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow-up email</a> after a few days.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most marketers and salespeople refrain from following up when their first email goes unanswered. According to data from Yesware, <a href="https://www.yesware.com/blog/sales-email-frequency-guide-pays-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">70 percent of unanswered sales email</a> chains stop after the first email.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="760" height="355" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118827" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-300x140.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-380x178.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-600x280.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-75x35.png 75w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-107x50.png 107w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-740x346.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-220x103.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image3-13-385x180.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, you have a 21 percent and 18 percent chance of getting a reply to your second and third emails, respectively. That said, never send 10 follow-up emails to a prospect. You have to recognize the difference between persistence and being annoying.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. Resolve Objections</strong></h2>



<p>Since no product is perfect, there’s always a space for objections. While you think your sales pitch is fantastic and prospects should beg you to sign the contract, some will say no.</p>



<p>When they say no, they’ll give you a reason why they’re unable to start using your tool right now. In some cases, these objections are just minor. In this case, you can convince them by providing more information about your product offering.</p>



<p>However, in some other cases, objections can be a way of rejecting your product. Whatever the type of objections you receive from a prospect, you should be ready with possible resolutions.</p>



<p>What are some common objections B2B leads can have?</p>



<ul><li>We’re already using a competitor.</li><li>Your product is too costly for our budget.</li><li>Your competitor has lower pricing.</li><li>There’s a lack of buy-in from my bosses.</li><li>We can’t use your tool at this time.</li></ul>



<p>Here, having a deep understanding of your product and the lead’s business will help resolve their objections. Even if they still say no, you can leave the communication channels open and try to convert them later with new information.</p>



<p>Successful objection resolution can be the difference between a new customer and a lost lead.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Close The Deal</strong></h2>



<p>After resolving your prospects’ objections, you can now close the deal.</p>



<p>For prospects who have no objection to your sales pitch, you can skip that step and close the deal. At this point, the lead is ready to become your customer. All you have to do is provide the information they need to become a customer.</p>



<p>This involves presenting possible <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/b2b-pricing-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing plans</a> and the costs. Better still, if you have a personalized plan that will suit their business best, you can show them.</p>



<p>Once you agree on the best plan for your prospect, the next step is to guide them through the payment options.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="7"><strong>7. Follow Up With New Customers</strong></h2>



<p>Congratulations! Now, you have a new customer. But there’s still more work to do.</p>



<p>At this stage, you’ll have to hand over your new customer to your customer success team. This team will onboard them and take them through the essential tasks they can perform with your product.</p>



<p>Of course, the customer success team should have information about your past interactions with the new customer. With the information, they’ll understand the customer’s goals and help achieve them.</p>



<p>But even after handing over the customer, you can’t cut all contact with them. You need to follow up with the customer success team <em>and</em> the customer.</p>



<p>After all, the customer bought the product because of the work you did and the promises you made. Are they getting the benefits you promised?</p>



<p>This may sound too easy, but few businesses do it. According to research from SuperOffice, only <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/resources/guides/customer-service-benchmark-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2.4 percent of companies follow up</a> with customers.</p>

<p>To make follow-up easier, you can set up a schedule and reminders at intervals. This will show that you care more about their results than just taking their money. In return, you’ll more likely retain your B2B customers and improve <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-lifetime-value">customer lifetime value</a>.</p>



<h2 id="8"><strong>8. Track Sales Performance to Update Process</strong></h2>



<p>An efficient B2B sales process is only as good as the results it can help you achieve. In light of that, there’s no B2B sales process set in stone.</p>



<p>You have to track how effective your sales process is moving leads closer to the sale and converting them to customers. Some metrics you need to track include:</p>



<ul><li>Sales qualified lead to win conversion rate</li><li>Average lead response time</li><li>Deals closed vs. goal</li><li>Sales growth vs. goal</li><li>Sales pipeline velocity</li></ul>



<p>From these numbers (and other critical metrics), you can see how effective your sales process is. Furthermore, you can track the effectiveness of each stage in the sales process. Are all the stages necessary for conversion?</p>



<p>By tracking your sales performance, you can make adjustments to your sales process to boost conversions even further.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Without making sales, no B2B company can survive. That’s why you and your sales team are always under pressure to convert every lead available.</p>

<p>I tried to help you with a simple process you can implement for a start. Once you implement the process, you can track its effectiveness in converting your B2B leads into sales.</p>



<p>Then, updating the sales process for your unique needs comes in later.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="preamble-block_6062f22b77ff8" class="block-preamble"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Key performance indicator” (KPI) is a classic piece of marketing jargon.</span></p>
</div>






<p>But unlike a lot of marketing jargon (“low-hanging fruit,” anyone?) it actually means something.</p>



<p>KPIs allow you to chart performance toward your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/objectives-and-key-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business objectives</a> through quantifiable data points or measurements. If you don’t have clearly defined KPIs, you’re effectively leaving things to chance.</p>



<p>Why are they so important?</p>



<p>Imagine your goal is to run a marathon. Would you set off running and hope you manage to reach 42 km? Or would you build a training plan built around key performance indicators, such as how many hours you spend doing cardio in the gym or how long it takes to recover between runs?</p>



<p>However naturally gifted you are, you’ll certainly see better results from the second approach—and e-commerce is no different.</p>



<p>Your goal might be to grow revenue by 20 percent year on year, but how are you going to get there? Rather than hoping it happens, far better to break down your overarching goal into KPIs that:</p>



<ul><li>Demonstrate whether you’re on the right track; and</li><li>Give you the opportunity to course-correct if things aren’t going as planned.</li></ul>



<p>With that in mind, here are nine vital e-commerce KPIs every brand should be tracking right now.</p>

<h2 id="1"><strong>1. Customer Acquisition Cost</strong></h2>



<p>There’s no such thing as an e-commerce business with too many customers.</p>



<p>More than two billion people <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/623566/web-visits-to-amazoncom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">visit Amazon.com every month</a>, but I can assure you Jeff Bezos doesn’t lie awake at night worrying about all that traffic—he wants more and more.</p>



<p>However, customer growth is only good if it’s sustainable.</p>



<p>If your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/average-order-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average order value</a> is €50 but it costs you €75 to acquire a new customer, every one of those new customers is losing you money. That’s why customer acquisition cost (CAC) is such an important KPI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CAC is simple to calculate. Take your total sales and marketing costs, then divide that figure by the number of new customers you won in a given period (say, a month).</p>



<p>So if I spent €10,000 on sales and marketing in March and brought in 1,000 new customers, my CAC was €10.</p>



<p>Is that good? Depends.</p>



<p>CAC on its own tells you nothing. It only gains meaning when balanced against other KPIs—specifically, <em>average order value </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-lifetime-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>customer lifetime value</em></a>. I’ll dig into them in the next two sections.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. Average Order Value</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, your average order value (AOV) is how much each customer spends at the tills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To work it out, divide your total revenue by the number of orders you received. If I made €100,000 in revenue from 5,000 orders, my AOV is €20.</p>



<p>On its own, that number doesn’t tell me much. However, I already know my CAC is €10, so if my AOV is double that figure, there’s a decent chance I’m running a sustainable business. (I can’t be certain, though—for that, I’d need to know my customer lifetime value too.)</p>



<p>By tracking your AOV over time, you can accurately measure your attempts to increase it.</p>



<p>Why’s that so important?</p>



<p>Because acquiring customers is expensive. According to one widely quoted stat, it costs <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">five times more</a> to attract a new customer than to retain an existing one.</p>



<p>If you can <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/upselling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drive up your average order value</a> by just a few euros, you’ll make a lot more money, without having to spend any more on acquisition. It’s pretty much the most efficient way to grow an e-commerce business.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. Customer Lifetime Value</strong></h2>



<p>The next piece in the “am I running a sustainable business?” puzzle is the customer lifetime value (CLV).</p>



<p>Simply put, CLV is the average net profit you make from each customer throughout their relationship with your brand.</p>



<p>To calculate CLV, you need to multiply three other metrics:</p>



<ol><li>Your average order value;</li><li>How many times the average customer buys from you per year; and</li><li>The average length of their relationship with you in years.</li></ol>



<p>We’ve already worked out my AOV is €20. So if my average customer buys three times a year and sticks with me for five years, my CLV is €300.</p>



<p>Now we’re starting to get some real meaning from these numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a general rule of thumb, your CLV to CAC ratio should be at or above 3:1. I’m only paying €10 to acquire each customer, but I’m making €300 from them.</p>



<p>Based on these numbers, it looks like I’ve laid the foundations for a sustainable, high-growth e-commerce business.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Conversion Rate</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve done a ton of work to <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/increase-e-commerce-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drive traffic to your site</a>. You’ve invested in <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-seo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO</a>, built social ads, and run paid search campaigns.</p>



<p>But all that time and money count for nothing if those visitors bounce straight back off the moment they land on your site.</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conversion rate</a>—the percentage of users who perform an action on your site—is another important KPI. It’ll tell you whether your key <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landing pages</a> are working as intended.</p>



<p>You might need to track a range of conversion rates, because you likely have more than one “action” you want visitors to perform. Those actions could include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/list-building-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opting in</a> for your newsletter;</li><li>Downloading a piece of content;</li><li>Signing up for your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-loyalty-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loyalty program</a>;</li><li>Adding a product to cart;</li><li>Buying a product.</li></ul>



<p>Conversion rates will vary widely depending on the type of action you’re tracking. For example, looking specifically at purchases, the average global e-commerce conversion rate stood at <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/439576/online-shopper-conversion-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2.58 percent</a> in Q2 2019.</p>



<p>A newsletter signup page might have a conversion rate of 20 percent because it’s a free, low-commitment transaction. On the other hand, I suspect the landing page for the €87,000 <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/models/design?redirect=no#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tesla Model S</a> converts at a slightly lower rate.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. Shopping Cart Abandonment</strong></h2>



<p>While conversion rate measures the proportion of people who <em>complete </em>the desired action, <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/cart-abandonment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shopping cart abandonment</a> does the opposite. It charts the percentage of users who fail to complete the action of making a purchase from your e-commerce site.</p>



<p>To calculate your abandonment rate, divide your number of completed purchases by the number of shopping carts opened, subtract the result from one, and then express it as a percentage.</p>



<p>So if I have 4,000 completed transactions from 10,000 shopping carts created, that’s an abandonment rate of 60 percent.</p>



<p>That number sounds astonishingly high, but it’s actually way better than most. According to the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Baymard Institute</a>, the average shopping cart abandonment rate stands at almost 70 percent.</p>



<p>Why are all those merciless online shoppers adding-to-bag then failing to buy? Baymard Institute gives us lots<em> </em>of reasons:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="600" height="616" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118795" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-292x300.png 292w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-380x390.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-34x35.png 34w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-49x50.png 49w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-477x490.png 477w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-220x226.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-16-385x395.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>One final point from the above study: the average large e-commerce site could see a 35.26 percent upturn in conversion rate by designing a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/checkout-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">better checkout.</a></p>



<p>Considering the combined value of all e-commerce sales in the EU and US, that equates to an eye-watering $260 billion in lost orders that could be recovered through improved checkout design and flow.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Ad Impressions</strong></h2>



<p>With <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">organic reach in decline</a>, e-commerce brands are increasingly finding that social media and search marketing are becoming pay-to-play environments.</p>



<p>If you’re running paid activity, whether paid search or social ads, you need to have KPIs in place around your campaigns. Otherwise, how can you tell if it’s working?</p>



<p>There are lots of metrics you could be tracked here, but one of the most important is ad impressions—the number of times your ad is fetched from its source and displayed. That could happen on a social platform, on a search engine results page, in an app, or on a third-party site.</p>



<p>You can find information on impressions within your advertising platform of choice, whether that’s Google, <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-facebook-ads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, Instagram, or something else.</p>



<p>Impressions and clicks are not the same. Just because your ad was presented to someone, that doesn’t mean they interacted with it. So why are they such a big deal?</p>



<p>For me, there are two main reasons:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Impressions are arguably the most controllable metric.</strong> If your impressions are dropping, that’s likely a sign you need to increase your budget and/or bid.</li><li><strong>Impressions control everything else. </strong>It doesn’t matter how compelling your ads are—if you’re not generating impressions, no one’s going to see them.</li></ol>



<h2 id="7"><strong>7. Return On Ad Spend</strong></h2>



<p>Another ad-specific metric, return on ad spend (ROAS) is pretty much what it sounds like—the amount of revenue you’re generating from your ad investment.</p>



<p>If I spend €10,000 on advertising for a return of €100,000, my ROAS is 10. Simple.</p>



<p>After impressions, it’s my second favorite ad metric (what do you mean you don’t have favorite ad metrics?).</p>



<p>That’s because it’s tied to your bottom line. Sure, cost per click, click-through rate, and conversion rate are all important too. But the only thing that really<em> </em>matters is whether your ads are making enough money.</p>



<p>As with CLV to CAC, the 3:1 ratio is a good guide to whether your return on ad spend is high enough. So if I’m spending €10,000 but only returning €20,000, my ad activity likely isn’t sustainable.</p>



<h2 id="8"><strong>8. Email Open Rate</strong></h2>



<p>Much like impressions, this one isn’t specifically related to e-commerce. But <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-email-marketing-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email marketing</a> is so essential to online retailers that I had to include it.</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/company/annual-report/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Campaign Monitor</a> figures, email generates an average return of $42 for every $1 invested. That’s way more than most brands will see from any other channel.</p>



<p>When it comes to measuring <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/increase-email-open-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open rates</a>, your chosen <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-email-marketing-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email marketing platform</a> will do all the calculations for you. If you’re seeing rates of 15-25 percent, you’re doing okay (the higher, the better).</p>



<h2><strong>9. Gross Profit Margin</strong></h2>



<p>The last three metrics have all been campaign and channel-specific, so for my final entry, I’m going to zoom back out and look at a big, overarching metric.</p>



<p>Gross profit margin shows you the difference between the <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/how-to-price-a-product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revenue</a> you generate and the profit you earn off the back of it. To calculate it, you need to know two things:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Total revenue: </strong>The number of units sold multiplied by the price.</li><li><strong>Cost of goods sold (COGS): </strong>Your total business costs, accounting for things like manufacturing, marketing, salaries, and operations.</li></ol>



<p>First, subtract COGS from total revenue. That’ll leave you with your gross profit. Then divide that figure by total revenue to calculate your gross profit margin.</p>



<p>So if my total revenue last month was €100,000 and my COGS was €70,000, I made a gross profit of €30,000 at a margin of 0.3, or 30 percent.</p>



<p>A high gross profit margin is, obviously, a good thing. It leaves you with plenty of cash to invest back into the business.</p>



<p>On the flip side, if your margin is low, growth will be stunted, and you’ll likely run into cash flow problems.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Sure, most people don’t start an e-commerce business because they love<em> </em>tracking KPIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they’ll always have some sort of goal in mind. Maybe it’s to become the biggest brand in their niche or to achieve a global presence. Or maybe it’s to sell the business for €1 billion, retire to a private island, and spend the rest of their days sipping mojitos.</p>



<p>Whatever your overarching objective(s), setting and monitoring individual KPIs will help you get there.</p>

<p><a href="#2">2. Three B2B Pricing Strategies</a></p>



<p><a href="#3">3. Key Points in Your Pricing Strategy</a></p>



<h2 id="1"><strong>What Is B2B Pricing?</strong></h2>



<p>B2B pricing is the process of setting and communicating prices to businesses and organizations your company sells to.<br><br>It sounds simple enough, but it’s often one of the largest challenges companies face. Why? Because companies get stuck on finding the best pricing strategy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simplest ones are easy to execute but often don’t end in the best results. More complex strategies are robust and they allow you to reach your goals, but they require a lot of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you choose the right pricing, I’ll go over the three most common B2B pricing strategies you can use for your business.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>B2B Pricing Strategies&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The three main B2B pricing strategies are cost-plus pricing, competitor-based pricing, and value-based pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below we go into further details on each strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>1. Cost-Plus Pricing</strong></h3>



<p>Cost-plus pricing is the most straightforward B2B pricing strategy. You take the cost of making your product or service (material costs, labor costs, and overhead costs), then sell it for more than it cost you to make it.<br><br>When determining your profit margin, consider how much you need to sell at that price to pay the rent, your employees, or any other operation cost your company has. The strategy requires next to no market research, consumer demands, or competitor strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retail companies often use a cost-plus pricing strategy. It’s also an excellent starting point for new online stores looking to incorporate pricing into their <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-marketing-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-commerce strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Say, you’re selling hats and these are your costs:</p>



<ul><li>Material costs: $2</li><li>Labor costs: $5</li><li>Overhead costs: $6</li></ul>



<p>Your total cost is $13. If you mark it up by 50 percent, the formula looks like this:</p>



<p><em>Selling price = $13 (13 x 0.5) = a markup of $6.5</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your B2B consumer selling price for each hat is $19.50.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This pricing strategy has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of cost-plus pricing:</p>



<ul><li>It’s simple for anyone to understand. You don’t need to conduct market research, competitor pricing analysis, or consider consumer demands.&nbsp;</li><li>It provides a consistent rate of return. When calculated right, this pricing strategy should cover all costs and provide you with a consistent income.&nbsp;</li><li>The price can be justified. Customers generally understand shifts in product pricing since manufacturing prices are forever changing in our global economy.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The disadvantages of cost-plus pricing:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>With minimal market research, the cost-plus strategy creates a profit losing culture. You should be aware of your competitors’ costs and customers’ <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/perceived-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perceived value</a> of the product to set the prices.</li><li>You could set the price too high, resulting in customers moving to your competitors.&nbsp;</li><li>As sales volume is projected before pricing the product, you may not cover all costs if you make few sales.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3><strong>2. Competitor-Based Pricing</strong></h3>



<p>Competitor-based pricing is often used to test product pricing. You begin by researching what your competitors are doing, what they offer, and at what price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re starting to get your first customers, you may not have enough data to get the perfect price for your customer base. Competitor data that has been in the market for a long time can give you a headstart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a competitor-based strategy, you need to consider two types of competitors: direct and indirect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can, for example, examine five direct and five indirect competitors and add them into a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/competitive-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competitor analysis</a> spreadsheet along with their pricing for a similar product.</p>

<p>Now, see where your product and brand fit between them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that you know where your product fits in the market, you can set a price for your product. There are three ways to do this.</p>



<h4><strong>i. Pricing above the competition</strong></h4>



<p>If you think your product offers better quality than your competitors, you can sell it as a higher-end version at a more expensive price.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>ii. Pricing on the same level</strong></h4>



<p>Also known as <em>price matching</em>, you can price your product the same as the competitor with the product most similar to yours. Focus on the added value of your product even if your features are the same.</p>



<h4><strong>iii. Pricing below the competition</strong></h4>



<p>Setting your prices lower than the competition can grab the customer’s attention, increase sales and brand value. Be aware that you may need to limit your product’s features and functionality to reach your desired profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advantages of competitive pricing:</p>



<ul><li>Competitor-based pricing requires little research and insight. All you need to do is compare yourself to your direct and indirect competitors and price your product where you feel it fits.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s low-risk since your competitors have been in the market for a while and have experienced trial and error.&nbsp;</li><li>By making prices similar to your competitor’s, consumers will be less inclined to switch from your brand to the other, allowing you to maintain your market share.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Disadvantages of competitive pricing:</p>



<ul><li>A competitor-based pricing strategy can work during the initial stages of market entry. But in the long run, your competitors may change their pricing to focus on different market segments. So, this pricing strategy can work better to attain short-term goals.&nbsp;</li><li>When you implement a competitor-based pricing strategy, you may not catch errors your competitors make. If they go wrong, so do you.&nbsp;</li><li>Pricing your product the same as your competitors makes you one with the herd. Your brand may struggle to stand out.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>3. Value-Based Pricing</strong></h3>



<p>Out of the most common pricing strategies mentioned above, value-based pricing is the most complex one. It requires in-depth research into your target audience, the market, and your competitors’ products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the research is well worth the effort. When you execute this strategy, not only do you gain the best profits, but you also learn significantly about your market and its demands.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/08/a-quick-guide-to-value-based-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Utpal Dholakia</a>, a marketing professor at Rice University, defines value-based pricing as “the method of setting a price by which a company calculates and tries to earn the differentiated worth of its product for a particular customer segment when compared to its competitor.”</p>



<p>Value-based pricing is a strategy for reaching long-term goals. Companies can build a framework that leverages their brand, product features, market position, and audience demographics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what goes into a value-based strategy?</p>



<h4><strong>i. Understanding your target audience</strong></h4>



<p>Perceived value is determined by customers. Starting with market research is crucial in understanding how your product affects your customers’ lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This research is a combination of demographics combined with qualitative information you can get from interviews. Try to understand the problem your product is solving for the customers, as well as what they’re willing to pay to solve that problem.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>ii. Researching your competitors</strong></h4>



<p>Any time you price a product, you must be able to justify the price. If your product is $40 more than your closest competitor, you should ask yourself the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>Is my product considerably more durable?</li><li>Does my product look and feel like it’s made out of quality material?</li><li>Does my product offer more features?</li><li>Are my manufacturing costs higher than competitors?</li></ul>



<p>Many businesses believe that value-based pricing is all about the value of their product. The reality is, your product’s value is only relative to what’s on the market. That’s why researching competitor pricing is essential for your B2B pricing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>iii. Determining the value of your differentiation</strong></h4>



<p>Now it’s time to put a quantitative value on the features you’ve discovered in your competitor research. You don’t need to assign a value to every product feature—simply calculate the value of the features that differentiate your product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a> and try to add value to the top of the pyramid.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="712" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-1024x712.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118786" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-1024x712.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-300x209.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-768x534.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-380x264.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-600x417.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-760x528.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-50x35.png 50w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-72x50.png 72w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-705x490.png 705w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-220x153.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16-385x268.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-16.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Focus on how your product will make the buyer feel. Will the product help your customers add value to their business? Will it help your customer reach their financial goals?</p>



<h4><strong>iv. Building pricing and marketing campaigns for your market</strong></h4>



<p>Now that you have a solid understanding of your audience, your competition, and your product’s value, you can start building your value-based B2B pricing strategy that is optimized for your product.</p>



<p>Advantages of a value-based pricing strategy:</p>



<ul><li>Pricing your products according to your customers adds value to your brand in the eyes of your customers.</li><li>You can increase your profits much more compared to the other two pricing strategies.&nbsp;</li><li>Adjusting the price to your buyer’s needs will increase customer loyalty and give you a more substantial clientele base.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Disadvantages of a value-based pricing strategy:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You may find yourself serving a niche market. In many cases being in the niche market is more profitable. However, it may be challenging to expand your business.&nbsp;</li><li>Competitors can create the same products and sell them at lower prices using the cost-plus or competitive B2B pricing strategies.</li><li>You may need to go through a long period of trial-and-error to find the right pricing balance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="3"><strong>Key Points in Your Pricing Strategy&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Finding the perfect price for your product is no walk in the park. It’s influenced by many factors such as the general economic environment, competition, perceived value, and emotional factors. Besides, every business you sell to has its own price sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few key points you should consider to create a robust B2B pricing strategy:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Product Type</strong></h3>



<p>You may have both premium products, commodity products, and custom products within your product line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commodity products usually offer lower margins as they tend to be highly price-sensitive. They should be priced differently than your premium or custom products, which are less price-sensitive and have higher margins. Begin by identifying your price categories based on the product types.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Market Growth Dynamics</strong></h3>



<p>Active growth and low saturation allow for better margins, while a plateauing market means increased price sensitivity. Your industry’s pricing environment influences your strategy, too. In some markets, an industry price leader’s movement can impact prices for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Customer Traits</strong></h3>



<p>Customers who buy in large volumes tend to be more price-sensitive than others. Those who purchase frequently are also more price-sensitive than the rest of your customers. Finally, customers who place a high value on relationships are less price-sensitive than those who look at other values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It helps to know where your customers are in their buying cycle.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to setting your B2B pricing, you have a few strategy options to consider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pricing strategy you follow will depend on where you are as a business. For example, if you are a new business, you may start with a simple approach such as a cost-plus pricing strategy until you have enough data to develop a value-based pricing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to test the waters. Try alternatives and see what works best for your business.</p>

<p>Get your pitch right and you get the business. But get it wrong and you’ll risk losing a customer.</p>



<p>Think of a sales pitch as your verbal business card that should be solid enough to make an excellent first impression. It must be concise and crisp to ensure the listener believes what you want them to.</p>



<p>But here’s where things get tricky: Our brains are wired to resist sales messages. So you need to nail down your sales pitch before meeting the potential client.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are a few tried-and-tested formulas that can help you come up with winning B2B sales pitches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on as I discuss the best sales pitch strategies, along with foolproof B2B sales pitch examples that’ll make your pitching game stronger.</p>

<h2 id="1"><strong>Strategy #1: Keep It Short and to-the-Point</strong></h2>



<p>Shorter is better when it comes to B2B sales pitches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A concise and direct pitch generates more interest for at least two reasons. First, the prospect is likely to listen to the whole thing as opposed to a rambling summary of product features, and second, you can get your point across faster and more easily as you’re forced to use simpler terms.</p>



<p>Here are two brilliant examples.</p>



<h3><strong>Adam Goldstein’s Two-Line Pitch</strong></h3>



<p>Selling is a delicate science. Instead of pages of elaborate <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-descriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">descriptions</a>, you only <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/power-words" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need the right words</a>—even if it&#8217;s two sentences long.</p>



<p>Adam Goldstein, the CEO, and co-founder of the travel deal site, <a href="http://hipmunk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hipmunk</a>, realized he needed a unique page, one that stands out from others, when he struggled to get sufficient funding for his startup.</p>



<p>The result? Goldstein came up with a two-line pitch that effectively summarized Hipmunk’s <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-value-proposition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value proposition</a>: <em>Lowering distribution costs.</em> </p>



<p>He sent the pitch to the CEO of United Airlines and got a response within 15 minutes. Eventually, Goldstein’s company went on to secure over $55 million from investors.</p>



<h3><strong>Shultz Photo School’s One-Liner</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://shultzphotoschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shultz Photo School</a> takes an even shorter route with its website one-liner: <em>We help parents take better pics.</em></p>



<p>Despite using six words only, the photography school manages to communicate to its visitors exactly what they can do for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how was Shultz able to do this?</p>



<p>They correctly identified their target audience’s (parents) biggest pain point, which was not being able to capture their children’s priceless moments properly, and then incorporated it in their one-line pitch.</p>



<p>Shultz doesn’t mention any photography technicalities like camera lenses, composition, lighting, angles, or any jargon that could potentially confuse the client.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All they say is how the company can help customers solve a specific problem.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-light-grey-background-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>Takeaway</h3>



<p>Think about the following questions when creating a short and concise B2B pitch:</p>



<ul><li>What does your product or service do? What are its benefits?</li><li>What is the unique selling proposition (USP) of your product or service? How is it different from your competitors?</li><li>What is the ultimate goal of a product or service? Think about the pain points that it can solve.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<h2 id="2"><strong>Strategy #2: Make It All About the Customer</strong></h2>



<p>Many sales executives make the common mistake of focusing their pitch around the product or service instead of the customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everybody likes to be the center of attention, and your customers are no exception.</p>



<p>Your pitch should provide a perspective based on your audience, so they know how your product or service can benefit <em>them </em>and why <em>they</em> should buy it from you.</p>



<p>This is also where <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-personalization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personalization</a> comes into the picture.</p>



<p>Make sure your sales pitch is relevant to your target audience and interesting enough to pique their attention. You should customize your messages in a way that addresses points that are most important to your customer.</p>



<p>Here are two examples of customer-centric sales pitches.</p>



<h3><strong>G2’s Elevator Pitch</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">G2</a> is a platform that gives software users the chance to share their opinions about a specific product or service. </p>



<p>In their sales pitch, G2 covers all the highlights of its platform and explains in basic terms how its service can solve the biggest pet peeve of its target audience (the disconnection between what customers need and what they get) in just 20 seconds.</p>



<p>What’s more, the pitch frames the customer’s needs and pain points while subtly mentioning how G2’s categorization method lets them easily compare competing software products in one place.</p>



<p><strong>Ryan Robinson’s Email Pitch</strong></p>

<p>Ryan Robinson is a content marketing consultant who relies on <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-email-marketing-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cold emailing</a> to reach out to potential clients—but not without doing his homework.</p>



<p>Before sending out cold emails, Robinson provides real upfront value to his recipient by either sharing their posts on Twitter or mentioning their brands or products on his blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This helps him earn points in the recipients&#8217; eyes that makes Robinson&#8217;s sales pitch stand out from other cold emails.</p>



<p>Robinson doesn’t talk about himself and his services until the third paragraph, followed by an <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/call-to-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effective call to action</a> that invites the reader for a chat. Overall, the recipient remains the main focus of the email.</p>

<h3><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>



<p>Here are a few tips to make your live pitches fun and engaging:</p>



<ul><li>Explain the advantages of your product quickly.</li><li>Add humor to your demonstrations.</li><li>Add additional visual aids, such as graphs, statistics, and charts, to make your story more interesting.</li><li>Practice how you’d approach the audience with the product beforehand.</li></ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<h2 id="3"><strong>Strategy #3: Show What Your Product or Service Can Do</strong></h2>



<p>What do door-to-door salesmen, magicians, and late-night infomercials have in common?</p>



<p>They try to create a “wow” moment by demonstrating the product or service’s most unique feature.</p>



<p>Although giving a demo of your product in your sales pitch costs time and resources, it’s a worthy investment. Check out how you can do that.</p>



<h3><strong>Joe Ades’s Live Peeling Demo</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Best Salesman in the World" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGOjFhKeLiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>You likely heard about this video before. A salesman, Joe Ades, shows his product (a carrot slicer) to pedestrians with an energetic attitude and a friendly smile, making him look more approachable and trustworthy.</p>



<p>He pitches his product directly by showing potential customers how the carrot slicer can help them have an easy peeling experience. Seeing the salesperson peel the carrots so effortlessly, in turn, compels his audience to give the product a try.</p>



<p>Why not do the same in your sales pitches?</p>



<h3><strong>Aaron Krause’s Scrubbing Tool Pitch</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Scrub Daddy Pitch (Shark Tank Season 4 Episode 7)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggi3yfUv0Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>If you’re an avid follower of Shark Tank, you might already be aware of Aaron Krause’s genius.</p>



<p>Krause, a contestant in Shark Tank, presents his sales pitch for a scrubbing tool that changes texture based on water temperature.</p>



<p>Although the product itself isn’t particularly inspiring, Krause uses his <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/story-based-emails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">storytelling</a> skills to strike a chord with the audience and judges by sharing how he came up with the idea.</p>



<p>Next, he supports his claims with a live presentation of how the product solves a common household problem (cleaning), showing the audience how useful his scrubbing tool can be. Krause also adds <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/funny-email-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humor</a> to his sales pitch to keep people engaged.</p>



<p>In the end, Krause’s pitch becomes a big hit with the judges, and his company, <a href="https://scrubdaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a>, goes on to make more than $50 million in sales.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div></div>



<h2 id="4"><strong>Strategy #4: Use Your Brand Story to Create Hype</strong></h2>



<p>Storytelling appeals to both children and adults, which makes it an excellent B2B sales pitching tactic that you must incorporate in your pitches.</p>



<p>If your product is similar to your competitors and you’re using similar marketing campaigns to promote and advertise it, you should use the power of storytelling in your pitches to stand out among your competitors.</p>



<p>Instead of reading out specifications, set a narrative around your product or service and tell your story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple’s</a> keynote videos are a masterclass for those wanting to create the perfect sales pitch.</p>



<p>It begins with the company’s rich history and moves the specifications of its products in a relatable and easy language. There is absolutely no use of jargon—only features that appeal to Apple’s audience.</p>



<p>The company ends the video by mentioning how Apple is excited for the future, where their customers will live a much easier life thanks to their products and features.</p>



<h3><strong>Amy Cuddy‘s Personal Story</strong></h3>

<p>The American social psychologist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Cuddy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amy Cuddy</a>, starts to narrate her personal story to the audience and eventually segues into her pitch. </p>



<p>Cuddy talks about how she had to drop out of college because of her car accident at the age of 19 and how she overcame the odds by simply &#8220;faking it&#8221; until she made it.</p>



<p>She also discusses how she adjusted her body language, shaped her mind, and her behavior—in less than two minutes.</p>



<p>The bottom line is, throughout her pitch, she keeps the focus on her story. Something you can model while improving your B2B sales pitches.</p>

<h2 id="5"><strong>Strategy #5: Build an Emotional Connection</strong></h2>



<p>One of the best ways to write a successful B2B sales pitch is to understand your customers and then convey it in your pitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using emotional appeal, for instance, can spark sympathy, which can compel the customer to buy your product or service.</p>



<p>The main goal is to <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trigger your customer’s emotions</a>, and here are two examples of it.</p>



<h3><strong>Mark Cuban’s Phone Pitch</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/video/watch-mark-cubans-best-ever-sales-pitch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mark Cuban</a>, the owner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dallas Mavericks</a>, had his work cut out for him when his team was struggling to win matches back in the early 2000s, which resulted in low ticket sales.</p>



<p>Cuban knew that low ticket sales would translate to heavy losses, which could really shake his company’s future. So he decided to take charge of the situation and get the ticket sales up.</p>



<p>Cuban got on the phone with former season ticket holders and asked them to come back to the game, reminding them of their experiences of going to the games as kids. He also emphasized how winning or losing of a team didn’t matter—the feeling did.</p>



<p>He was able to stroke his listeners’ nostalgic chords by talking about the stadium, the game, and the memories they had with friends and families.</p>



<p>Cuban’s compassionate and understanding approach was impressive. In turn, his pitch helped him make many customers believe that spending $8 on a match ticket was more valuable than going to the movies or McDonald’s.</p>



<p>Cuban had bought the Mavericks for $280 million. The team is now valued at <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2021/02/19/mavs-come-in-at-no-9-on-forbes-list-of-most-valuable-nba-teams-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$2.25 billion.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://drift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Drift&#8217;s</a> campaign is another stellar example of how building an emotional connection with your audience could work wonders for boosting sales. </p>



<p>The above slide shows that you don’t have to agree with everything your audience believes in and how instead, making a claim bold enough to raise a few eyebrows can make them see things your way.</p>



<p>The first part of Drift’s slide starts with an undeniable truth (“Technology has changed the way we operate”). Out of the blue, they make a contrasting claim: “Forms, emails, and calls are bad”. This isn’t something the reader expects after seeing the first slide.</p>



<p>They then offer the reasoning behind their bold claim (“We should focus on creating real conversations”) while cleverly leveraging Drift as the perfect solution to solve this problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Image Source: </em><a href="https://www.prontomarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Pronto Marketing</em></a></p>



<p>NPS is a metric that measures how many customers are willing to recommend your products to other people. Think of it as a measurement to know how loyal your customers are to your product or service.</p>



<p>This is a crucial metric every business owner should keep track of because it gives them a direct insight into customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andy Taylor, the CEO of <a href="https://www.enterprise.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Enterprise Rent-A-Car</a>, wanted to ditch the typical bulky <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-satisfaction-surveys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer satisfaction surveys</a> to enhance customer loyalty efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He came up with an approach that aligns with the concept of the NPS, where his team blasted out monthly polls that asked users two simple questions:</p>



<ol><li>How was the quality of your rental car experience?</li><li>Are you likely to rent from the company again?</li></ol>



<p>Within a week, the company had raised results for 5000 US branches, which gave them real-time feedback on their performance and improvement areas at an unparalleled speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Taylor was a visionary, it was <a href="https://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fred Reichheld</a> that came up with the Net Promoter Score system after years of research and testing. And the main reason behind designing the Net Promoter Score is to effectively gauge customer loyalty.</p>



<p>All companies have to do was get answers to a single question: <em>“How likely is it that you recommend (Your Company) to a friend?”</em></p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>How to Calculate NPS</strong></h2>



<p>Your goal with NPS is to learn how likely it is for your customers to recommend your products. And that’s exactly what you should be asking in your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-survey-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a>.</p>



<p>However, instead of asking for a simple “yes” or “no” answer, have respondents choose a rating between 0 and 10. After you collect all the answers, group them in the following way:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Promoters –</strong> People who respond with 9-10.</li><li><strong>Passage –</strong> People who respond with 7-8.</li><li><strong>Detractors –</strong> People who respond with 0-6.</li></ul>



<p>Let’s explain what each group means.</p>



<h3><strong>Promoters</strong></h3>



<p>Promoters are your satisfied and loyal customers. These are the people that would recommend your company or website to others.</p>



<p>Promoters are easier to manage and cultivate a long-term relationship with. That said, you can improve your relationship with promoters by sending them exclusive discounts, free delivery, guides, free eBooks, and so on.</p>



<h3><strong>Passives</strong></h3>



<p>Passives are satisfied yet not enthusiastic customers. This group covers the people who aren’t necessarily excited about their experience with your company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your goal should be to convert passives into promoters for a better NPS. Otherwise, you’ll risk them turning into detractors.</p>



<h3><strong>Detractors</strong></h3>



<p>Simply put, detractors are unhappy customers. It’s highly unlikely for them to recommend your product or service to others. This may cause negative word-of-mouth, which can put a serious dent in your profits.</p>



<p>Make your customers feel special and they&#8217;ll become your biggest assets. But make them feel mistreated and your sales will go down fast.</p>



<p>Ask follow-up questions to find out why detractors had an unpleasant experience in your store and find solutions to improve that specific aspect of your business. In the long run, a detractor may convert into a passive or even a promoter.</p>



<p>But how do you calculate your overall NPS?</p>

<p>It’s simple: <strong>Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</strong></p>



<p>Let me explain with an example.</p>



<p>Suppose you survey 100 customers. You find out that 64 percent of them are your promoters, while 12 percent are your detractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So your NPS will be 64–12=52.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>What Is a Good NPS Score?</strong></h2>



<p>A net promoter score below zero means your business has serious issues that need to be addressed immediately. On the other hand, any score between 0 and 30 is a good range to be in. There’s still room for improvement, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting a score higher than 30 means your e-commerce company has a healthy ratio of happy customers to unhappy ones. For comparison, SPG Consulting found that the <a href="http://www.spg-consulting.com/newsletters/2013-q1-2-net-promoter-score-interpretation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">average NPS is 34.3</a>.</p>



<p>An NPS of over 70 means you’re thriving. You&#8217;re doing things right—your customers like you, and your company is likely generating positive word-of-mouth through referrals.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>Why Is NPS Crucial for Your E-Commerce Store?</strong></h2>



<p>Building an army of promoters comes doesn’t happen overnight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are certain things you need to take care of to ensure high customer satisfaction. This includes a user-friendly e-commerce site, a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-personalization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personalized</a> shopping experience, responsive customer service, and repeatedly implementing customer feedback.</p>



<h3><strong>NPS Eliminates Negative Word-of-Mouth</strong></h3>



<p>When customers say good things about you, it’ll help you boost your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a study, BrightLocal found that <a href="https://searchengineland.com/2013-study-79-of-consumers-trust-online-reviews-as-much-as-personal-recommendations-164565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">84 percent of participants</a> use online reviews and friends to determine which products or services to use. Use NPS surveys to find your true advocates and incentivize them to ensure positive word-of-mouth and increase <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/referral-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">referrals</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t forget about your detractors, though. Brainstorm ways to turn them into ambassadors to prevent any negative publicity.</p>



<h3><strong>NPS Establishes Customer Loyalty and Promotes Growth</strong></h3>



<p>It doesn’t take more than one percent to make a big difference.</p>



<p>iiNet achieved an additional <a href="https://medium.com/@mozyrko/finding-the-roi-of-customer-experience-4e85cf489d05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$1.6 million net profit</a> following a one percent increase in its NPS score.</p>



<p>To implement NPS on your e-commerce site, you can choose one of the tools in the market that regularly tracks your scores. Tools like <a href="https://www.getfeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GetFeedback</a> or <a href="https://survicate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Survicate</a> gather and analyze data in real-time to improve your customer satisfaction and sales.</p>



<h3><strong>NPS Develops a Competitive Edge Over Competitors</strong></h3>



<p>Over the past years, e-commerce websites have shown exceptional growth, which means you’re likely facing stiff competition in the market.</p>



<p>By using your NPS feedback, you can actively address customer problems and understand every issue a customer faces that can negatively affect customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Carefully analyze your data to gain more insights into customer behavior and understand how they interact with your business.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>How to Implement NPS in E-Commerce</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we’ve covered the importance of NPS and how to calculate it, let’s figure out how you can use it to further contribute to your e-commerce goals.</p>



<h3><strong>Give Every Customer Equal Importance</strong></h3>



<p>Your NPS score depends on how accurately you <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-survey-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> your customers. If your NPS survey only reaches a selective group of customers, you’ll get an artificially high or low score, which, in turn, will make it difficult for you to take action.</p>



<p>For instance, if your e-commerce store allows both registered and unregistered customers to check out, you must survey both groups. If only registered customers take part in your survey, you risk seeing an artificially high score.</p>



<p>Overall, you need a consistent NPS process and a fair sample of your customers to avoid producing skewed results.</p>



<h3><strong>Go Beyond the Score</strong></h3>



<p>NPS should be simple. Ironically, it’s the same simplicity that can be its biggest weakness.</p>



<p>Many e-commerce managers see NPS simply as a number, which makes them shift all their focus on moving the number upwards at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A better approach is to go through the comments from your customers, especially detractors, and identify the potential issues in your sales, payment, and order fulfillment processes. This way, you’ll be able to eliminate factors that hurt the customer experience.</p>



<h3><strong>Motivate Your Team to Improve their Performance&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Customer loyalty is the very foundation of the NPS system. Unfortunately, though, creating a company that maintains loyalty isn’t something that is achieved overnight.</p>



<p>You and your employees have to be receptive to your customers and improving their experiences. Making your employees embrace the NPS spirit by tying their performances to it can be a good starting point to get better results.</p>



<h3><strong>Prioritize Improvement, Not Benchmarks</strong></h3>



<p>NPS benchmarks can help you estimate the range your score falls within, but you shouldn’t use them to directly compare your business with your competitors.</p>



<p>Most NPS benchmark reports are problematic because they group businesses into broad categories. Small e-commerce stores end up in the same category as bigshots like Amazon, creating unreliable results.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on meeting the average, you should prioritize the continuous improvement of your business and NPS over the long term.</p>



<h3><strong>Don’t Forget “Closing the Loop”</strong></h3>



<p>Once you collect customer feedback, remember to take action and respond directly to the customer’s concerns, compliments, or complaints.</p>



<p>Data shows that even a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryjao/2015/01/21/customer-retention-is-king-retention-marketing-provides-greater-roi/?sh=2beafe2332cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">5 percent increase</a> in customer retention can result in a 25-95 percent improvement in profit. Therefore, you should remember to close the loop with detractors after implementing NPS.</p>

<h2><strong>Over to You</strong></h2>



<p>That was everything you need to know about e-commerce NPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping an eye on your NPS can help you understand your target customers better, know their likes and dislikes, and improve any shortcomings and flaws in your online store.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t expect overnight change, but by actively tracking NPS, you can eventually create an army of loyal customers, leading to more revenue in the future.<br><em>Are you using NPS surveys on your e-commerce site? Share your experience below.</em></p>

<h2 id="1"><strong>1. Online Buying Isn’t Going to Be Limited to B2C Products</strong></h2>



<p>B2C, B2B, D2C, D2B&#8230;</p>



<p>Consumers are turning to e-commerce for all their daily needs. Food, <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/fashion-popup-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fashion</a>, and gadgets aren’t the only things that people buy online anymore—vehicles, furniture, and groceries have also joined the list.</p>



<p>E-commerce was simply a convenience before, but now many of us depend on it. That’s why you need to adjust your <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-marketing-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing strategies</a> accordingly to lock in more market share.</p>



<p>The ongoing pandemic has also accelerated digital transformation across the globe. These changes may slow down as people return to their normal routine, but they won’t stop.</p>



<p>Make sure to bring your products online if you’re not doing it already. This way, you&#8217;ll get access to a wider audience, while making it easier for your customers to buy from you.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. Customers Will Use Their Voice More</strong></h2>



<p>Three years ago, e-commerce transactions via smart speakers, such as Alexa and Google Home, totaled $2 billion in the UK and US. This figure is expected to <a href="https://www.occstrategy.com/media/1285/the-talking-shop_uk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reach a staggering $40 billion</a> within the next year.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, nearly <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2020/04/28/nearly-90-million-u-s-adults-have-smart-speakers-adoption-now-exceeds-one-third-of-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">90 million Americans</a>, are going to use smart speakers regularly, and about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1022847/united-states-smart-speaker-household-penetration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75 percent of US households</a> will own a smart speaker by 2025.</p>



<p>These numbers tell how smart speaker technology is going to grow at a very fast rate.</p>



<p>Today, e-commerce businesses must have a voice strategy as it’s an important link that connects them with customers, especially considering the latter rely more and more on voice assistants to complete even the basic tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prepare your e-commerce site for voice search by optimizing your content and offer voice-based navigation for your website and mobile app. Customers should also be able to buy your products using voice commands.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. AI Will Be More Human and Less Artificial</strong></h2>



<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning can play an important role to ensure a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/personalized-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more personalized and automated shopping experience</a> for customers. </p>



<p>You see, experts are using this technology to continuously collect data on buying patterns, what customers look for in a product or service, and when they make purchases.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also why AI and MI both are being hailed to become the virtual equivalent of a salesperson that helps customers find suitable items based on their appearance and style.</p>



<p>By employing this technology on your website, you can make the overall shopping experience more convenient.</p>



<p>You can use AI tools to create and implement better marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and perform critical tasks that could spur your growth.</p>

<p><a href="https://sparktoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SparkToro</a> is an excellent example of this. By crawling social media profiles to learn what your audience prefers, the tool helps you deliver better and more personalized experiences.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Personalization Will Go Beyond Sales</strong></h2>



<p>Customers have unique needs and want their experiences to be tailored according to them. In fact, <a href="https://smarterhq.com/privacy-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">72 percent of customers</a> only engage with personalized messaging.</p>



<p>You can establish customer loyalty by using the data about your customers, such as the last purchase they made or the kind of items they typically buy and <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommending products</a> based on their usual behavior. Take <a href="https://www.enfamil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Enfamil&#8217;s</a> brilliant example.</p>

<p>This instant formula brand requests expecting mothers to provide their tentative due dates when signing up for their <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/list-building-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email list</a> in exchange for useful tips and insights about their pregnancy.</p>



<p>Not only are they able to grow their email list this way, but also provide valuable advice, which helps the brand win more brownie points.</p>



<p>Similarly, you can also create a CRM database to store relevant information in a single place irrespective of where the customer chooses to interact, and deliver a highly personalized customer service experience.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. It’s the Era of Chatbots</strong></h2>



<p>Shoppers want to find and buy a product in just a few clicks. If they can’t, they get frustrated.</p>



<p>A chatbot can step in and solve their problems by helping them along the process and boost conversions.</p>



<p>Many e-commerce businesses already use chatbots to interact with online shoppers just like an in-store sales associate would. What’s more, <a href="https://linchpinseo.com/chatbot-statistics-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80 percent of businesses</a> are projected to integrate some form of chatbot system by the end of 2021.</p>



<p>Consider adding a chatbot to your website to make it easier for customers to shop from your online store.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Omnichannel Is the New Normal</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/omni-channel-marketing">Omnichannel</a> retailing is the process of providing shoppers a seamless and consistent experience across all channels and devices.</p>



<p>This is incredibly important considering the growing adoption of mobile devices and voice assistants. In fact, in a survey by Harvard Business Review, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">73 percent of respondents</a> said they use multiple channels during the shopping journey.</p>



<p>Make sure your website is optimized for mobile devices and offers purchase options like “buy online,” “pick up in-store” or “buy in-store,” “choose home delivery,” and more. You can also use tools like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAP Commerce Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.finteza.com/en">Finteza</a> to ensure a personalized and comprehensive e-commerce experience.</p>



<h2 id="7"><strong>7. Adopt Video or Risk Being Irrelevant</strong></h2>



<p>Social media consumption isn’t slowing down and nobody expects them to.</p>



<p>The audience today is more interested in video, which is why shoppable video ads can play a huge role in capturing more market share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of all the media platforms, TikTok and Instagram have gained widespread prominence among the public, especially Generation Z. That’s why many e-commerce businesses also started incorporating these platforms into their advertising campaigns.</p>



<p>Whether you use them for tutorials or unboxing, video adds another dimension to your marketing. So there’s tremendous potential for you to capitalize on the video frenzy.</p>



<h2 id="8"><strong>8. The (Even Greater) Rise of the Influencers</strong></h2>



<p>Many e-commerce brands already tapped into the influence market. This explains the projected <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report#:~:text=The%20influencer%20marketing%20industry%20is,gold%20standard%20for%20the%20group." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$15 billion valuations</a> of the industry come 2022.</p>



<p>Many e-commerce brands are unable to produce enough content at scale to match their marketing efforts—a problem that influencers conveniently solve. Online sellers will also add paid media spend to this content to gain greater control over their reach and audience.</p>



<p>You can find (local) influencers and publications related to your industry niche, and then branch out to other markets to get a better picture of consumer behavior.</p>



<p>While doing that, remember to take advantage of the latest social media features, such as <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reels on Instagram.</a> This way, you can enjoy the popularity of the masses and expand your reach more effectively. </p>



<h2 id="9"><strong>9. Mobile Commerce Will Reign Supreme</strong></h2>



<p>Experts predict that by the end of 2021, mobile devices will make about <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/13139/estimated-worldwide-mobile-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">73 percent of total e-commerce sales</a>.</p>



<p>As an online store owner, you should prioritize improving the customer experience for mobile users. Plus, customers tend to feel more comfortable making purchases using their mobile phones.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seosandwitch.com/ecommerce-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30 percent of online shoppers</a> are likely to abandon their carts if they find out your website isn’t mobile-friendly. And considering how easy it is to optimize your e-commerce store for mobile phones, this is something you should take seriously. </p>



<p>Start by testing the mobile-friendliness of your website by using <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Mobile-Friendly Test</a>.</p>

<p>You can, for example, create a Progressive Web App (PWA) to tackle page load speed issues, or implement Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to ensure a smoother checkout process for mobile shoppers.</p>



<h2 id="10"><strong>10. Customers Will Embrace Green Consumerism</strong></h2>



<p>Consumers and brands are getting greener. <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-elusive-green-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">65 percent of buyers</a> want to make purchases from brands that are aiming for sustainability.</p>



<p>E-commerce giants like Amazon have already <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken a pledge</a> to be sustainable, and we can expect other e-commerce companies to follow suit.</p>



<p>Take a look at your products and consider adopting a more sustainable process, if you haven’t already done so. This can include reducing the amount of packaging waste, transportation costs, and so on.</p>



<p>You can also team up with a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/nonprofit-popup-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">non-profit</a> that aligns with your brand’s vision and attract green consumers while contributing to preserving the environment.</p>

</div>






<p>Once this aim was more of a vague notion than a specific priority, but today customer experience has become the <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">number one focus for business leaders</a>. Here’s what they said when asked for their business priorities over the coming five years:</p>



<ol><li>Customer experience (chosen by 45.9 percent of respondents)</li><li>Product (33.6 percent)</li><li>Pricing (20.5 percent)</li></ol>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. “Customer experience is more important than my product? Surely that can’t be right?”</p>



<p>This shouldn’t be so surprising. <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/satisfaction-guarantees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Happy customers</a> are happy for a reason. Maybe you delighted them with a surprise discount, a silky-smooth buying process, or lightning-fast delivery.</p>



<p>In other words, they feel happy because of something you did, and they’re prepared to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reward you for it</a>. They’ll pay up to 16 percent more for your product, and they’ll be more loyal to your brand, too.</p>



<p>To improve your customer experience and make them even more satisfied, you first need to understand how happy they are right now.</p>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-survey-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E-commerce surveys</a> are one of the best ways to do this. With that in mind, here are 9 best practices to help you create effective, insightful surveys.</p>

<h2 id="1"><strong>1. Choose the Survey Type That Best Fits Your Needs</strong></h2>



<p>E-commerce surveys are like a bag of Matador Mix—they come in many flavors. Those flavors include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-satisfaction-surveys#leverage-an-nps-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Net Promoter Score</strong></a><strong> (NPS):</strong> Customers are asked a single, simple question—“How likely are you to recommend our business to a friend or colleague?”—and asked to give a score from 1 to 10.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):</strong> Designed to assess a customer’s feeling toward a specific event. Customers are asked to answer, in the form of a rating from 1 to 5, a question like: “How would you rate the quality of your most recent service interaction?”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customer Effort Score (CES): </strong>Used to measure how easy (or hard) it was for the customer to complete a specific action. The classic CES question reads: “On a scale of ‘very easy’ to ‘very difficult’, how easy was it to interact with <em>Company X</em>?”</li></ul>



<p>As well as the quantitative<em> </em>data-gathering described above, each survey type can also include a qualitative<em> </em>element in which respondents are asked to explain their initial rating.</p>



<p>Each survey type has its strengths and weaknesses, and the right choice for you will depend on the purpose of your survey:</p>



<ul><li><strong>NPS: </strong>These quick-and-easy surveys tend to generate high response rates and, because they’re quite general, can be used at any point in the customer lifecycle. The results are most meaningful when NPS surveys are sent regularly over an extended period.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>CSAT: </strong>If you’re looking to measure the performance of your customer service function, a CSAT survey is the one for you.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>CES: </strong>Looking to identify speed bumps in your path to purchase and smooth out your user journey? A CES survey is your best bet.</li></ul>



<p>Alternatively, you could build a custom e-commerce survey using a tool like <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SurveyMonkey</a>, where you can ask whatever you want—but you’ll need to do all the legwork yourself.</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. Get Your Timing Right</strong></h2>



<p>Timing is everything with a survey. To get the most insightful results, you need to identify the actions that make a customer a good candidate for your survey.</p>



<p>If I’ve not interacted with your brand for six months, it’d be a weird time to ask my thoughts on your user experience. But it could be a good time to dig into why<em> </em>I’ve not purchased from you recently (particularly if I’ve previously been a regular customer).</p>



<p>Clearly, those key actions will vary based on the purpose of your survey, but common touchpoints include:</p>



<ul><li>After a customer returns an item they’ve purchased;</li><li>After a customer takes delivery of a new product;</li><li>After a returning shopper <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/cart-abandonment-popup-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandons their basket</a>;</li><li>After a support agent resolves a customer query; and</li><li>After a customer downloads your app.</li></ul>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. Start Big-Picture, Then Get Granular</strong></h2>



<p>Imagine you’ve visited a friend’s house for dinner. They want to know if you’re enjoying yourself, so they ask a bunch of questions: “How’s the lighting? Do you like the wine? Is your seat comfortable? Have you eaten enough? How’s the temperature? Is the music too quiet?”</p>



<p>Then, at the end of the night, they ask: “Did you have a nice time?”</p>



<p>By that point, they’ve already forced you to scrutinize every tiny aspect of the evening, including a bunch of things you might never have considered if they hadn’t asked. That’s definitely going to have an impact—probably a negative one—on your overall verdict.</p>



<p>That’s why you should always start out by asking customers your broadest and most important question, such as how likely they are to recommend your brand, or whether they found you <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-conversion-rate-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy to buy from</a>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve asked that big-picture question, dig down into the specifics to provide context for their initial response.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Make a Habit of Sending Regular Surveys</strong></h2>



<p>Don’t treat e-commerce surveys as a one-and-done activity.</p>



<p>Sure, a single survey will provide you with a snapshot of how happy your customers are at a specific point. But <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/e-commerce-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-commerce</a> is a fast-moving industry, and that information won’t mean much three months down the line.</p>



<p>Instead, send surveys regularly. NPS is only an effective metric if you survey every customer—or at least, a decent chunk of your customers—after they make a purchase. Done regularly, it allows you to track satisfaction over time. Done once, it doesn’t tell you much at all.</p>



<p>There are other benefits to regular e-commerce surveys, too. For one thing, they demonstrate to customers that you’re genuinely invested in improving their experience.</p>



<p>And for another, they let you chart how your actions have influenced customer happiness. If your NPS increases after you switch to a new delivery partner or <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-e-commerce-website-builders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build a new website</a>, that’s a good sign your efforts are paying off.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. Cut Out Unnecessary Noise</strong></h2>



<p>You probably won’t be surprised to learn that the more questions you include in a survey, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/mp/tips-increasing-survey-completion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the fewer responses you’ll get</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="651" height="376" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118524" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10.png 651w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-300x173.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-380x219.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-600x347.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-61x35.png 61w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-87x50.png 87w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-220x127.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1-10-385x222.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></figure>



<p>The lesson here? Don’t get greedy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This might sound like an obvious point, but it’s too easy to include questions that you’d like, but don’t need, to know the answer to. Those questions are unnecessarily elongating your survey, which means you’ll end up with less data overall.</p>



<p>Do you really need to know how a respondent first heard about your brand? Will it tell you anything you can’t find out in five seconds on Google Analytics? If you don’t have a watertight reason for including a question, shelve it.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Keep It Short</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, survey abandonment isn’t solely about how many questions you ask—it’s also about the complexity of those questions.</p>



<p>The same SurveyMonkey study I referenced in the previous section gives us some valuable insight on this. Specifically, it tells us there’s a 10 percent point drop in completion rates between surveys with one open-ended question and surveys with 10 such questions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="598" height="389" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118526" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11.png 598w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-300x195.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-400x260.png 400w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-380x247.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-54x35.png 54w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-77x50.png 77w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-220x143.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2-11-385x250.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></figure>



<p>That’s because open-ended, free-form questions are harder to answer. It’s not a case of choosing a number from 1 to 5; you have to think—and type—your response.</p>



<p>So how long should your study take to complete?</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2501/IJMR-2017-039?journalCode=mrea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">International Journal of Market Research</a>, the ideal survey takes 10 minutes to finish, and the maximum length should be 20 minutes. Any longer than that and you’ll see a big spike in abandon rates.</p>



<h2 id="7"><strong>7. Only Offer a Small Range of Ratings</strong></h2>



<p>You might think a wide rating system is more desirable because it lets your customers give more nuanced responses. But in reality, it could be making your survey harder to complete and ruining your data.</p>



<p>Think about it. Say I’ve asked you to rate this blog post on a scale of 1-3. Easy, right? If you hate it, you’ll score it one. If you love it, I get a three. If you like some parts but hate others, call it a two.</p>



<p>But what if I asked you to rate it out of 10? If you have extreme feelings toward my writing, that’s fine. But how do you choose between a seven or eight? What’s a six?</p>



<p>And more to the point, if I asked 10 other people to do the same thing, how can I be sure they all assigned the same meaning to their scores?</p>



<p>You get the picture. Sure, a broad scale might sound more meaningful, but in reality, it can be exactly the opposite.</p>



<h2 id="8"><strong>8. Send a Test Survey Before the Real One</strong></h2>



<p>As with any data-gathering exercise, it’s best to sense-check your survey before rolling it out at scale.</p>



<p>To do that, send it to a select group of customers first and see what comes back. Also, add a few questions about the experience of filling out the survey, or send them as a separate mini-survey.</p>



<p>This approach will help you assess:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Completion rates: </strong>Are you getting enough responses? If not, you may be asking too many open-ended questions, or simply too many questions altogether.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Data quality: </strong>Do the results give you the insights you need? Or is your data too broad or too specific?</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Data type: </strong>Are you acquiring enough qualitative data to add meaning to all the numbers?</li></ul>



<p>Don’t be afraid to do this multiple times before you send the first “real” survey to all<em> </em>your customers. These surveys will play a key role in informing future customer experience decisions, so you need to be completely satisfied with the quality of the data you’re seeing.</p>



<h2 id="9"><strong>9. Steer Clear of Loaded Questions</strong></h2>



<p>As humans, we naturally want to be loved. We also want things to appear better than they really are. Those two factors can be a major barrier to creating effective and meaningful e-commerce surveys.</p>



<p>You want people to like your brand, so you ask them a question that inadvertently (or deliberately) skews their opinion in your favor.</p>



<p>Or you were personally involved in rolling out a new feature or product, so you highlight how great it is, again influencing the customer’s response.</p>



<p>Leading questions might help you gain higher survey scores. But those scores won’t be valuable, because they won’t accurately reflect how your customers feel about you. That could lead you to make poor decisions based on bad numbers.</p>



<p>What do these deadly leading questions look like? Here’s a great example from <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/curiosity/how-to-avoid-asking-leading-and-loaded-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SurveyMonkey</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Leading question: </strong>“Our customer support team is rated as being the most responsive in the industry. How responsive—or unresponsive—do you think they are?”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Neutral question: </strong>“What do you think of our customer support team?”</li></ul>



<p>It’s tempting to ask the first question. But if your support team is really<em> </em>that good, you need to trust that your customers will recognize this and score them accordingly.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>If you only take one thing with you from reading this article, let it be this: <strong>there’s no such thing as a “bad” e-commerce survey score</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, you want your customers to be ecstatic all the time, so high scores are the ultimate goal. But a low score is arguably a lot more valuable. If your customers aren’t<em> </em>happy, you must know about it so you can course-correct and shake things up.</p>



<p>So build your surveys, embrace the results (good or bad), and use them to bring about positive change.</p>

<div id="preamble-block_6051f2abd5948" class="block-preamble"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got a great product. When people buy it, you deliver it on time. So surely everyone loves you?</span></p>
</div>






<p>Not necessarily. Product and fulfillment are only two parts in the customer satisfaction puzzle. If you provide a poor experience to customers, it really doesn’t matter if you offer the cheapest or highest-quality product on the market—there’s a good chance you’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>The thing is, shoppers, don’t have a “three-strikes” policy. According to business intelligence firm SAS, one in three customers would ditch a brand after a single <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_gb/news/press-releases/2020/october/a-third-of-customers-would-ditch-companies-after-just-one-poor-experience.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">poor experience</a>, while 90 percent would do so after two to five poor experiences. Instead of buying from you, they’ll look elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, if you’re delivering a bad customer experience, you’re effectively doing your competitors’ marketing for them.</p>



<p>But while it’s undeniably important, “customer experience” is quite a nebulous term that can mean different things to different people. When respondents to the same SAS survey were asked to rank their biggest customer experience concerns, the results were wide-ranging and evenly spread:</p>



<ol><li>Convenience (cited by 38 percent of respondents)</li><li>Responsive customer support (32 percent)</li><li>Responsible behavior (29 percent)</li><li>Flexible returns and refunds (25 percent)</li></ol>



<p>So how can you possibly understand what your customers most want from you?</p>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-satisfaction-surveys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E-commerce surveys</a> hold the answer. Here are 15 examples—plus what’s good about each—to help you build your next survey.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Charlotte Tilbury</a> is an upper-tier cosmetics brand with an aspirational product set. This is reflected in its e-commerce surveys, which have a pretty high-end feel to them.</p>

<p>The tone of voice is spot-on, referring to the shopper as “Darling”, and inviting them to “tag your Tilbury” on social media—you wouldn’t do that with a €10 bottle of foundation you picked up at the supermarket.</p>



<p>But this email isn’t all style and no substance. There are some smart design choices here, too.</p>



<p>By laying out multiple purchases in the same email, rather than requesting reviews on multiple items individually, the whole process is streamlined. That’s effective because the last thing you want is to make it hard for customers to <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review your products</a>.</p>



<p>This choice of layout also subtly reminds you how many items you bought at once, and therefore how much you love Charlotte Tilbury. Maybe it’s time to buy some more?</p>



<h2 id="2"><strong>2. ASOS</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/fashion-popup-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fashion</a> e-commerce giant <a href="http://asos.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ASOS</a> saw its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/485103/asos-revenue-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revenues increase sixfold</a> between 2012 and 2020 to almost €4 billion, so it’s clearly doing something right. One of those things is definitely its e-commerce surveys.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="420" height="1024" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-420x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118460" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-420x1024.png 420w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-123x300.png 123w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-630x1536.png 630w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-380x926.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-600x1462.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-14x35.png 14w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-21x50.png 21w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-201x490.png 201w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-220x536.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10-385x938.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image6-10.png 645w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></figure></div>



<p>Imagine you’re the customer who just received that email. Your order arrived earlier today and you love everything in it. Maybe you’re even wearing your new oversized vintage shirt right now.</p>



<p>But however much you love a purchase, it’s not always easy to put your thoughts into words. What <em>specifically </em>do you love about it?</p>



<p>This is a problem because a lot of review sites don’t just ask for a star rating—they want to know <em>why </em>you like it, too. That’s understandable because a bunch of blank five-star reviews looks super spammy. But on the other hand, it could be putting people off leaving reviews at all.</p>



<p>ASOS prevents this by giving shoppers a few subtle examples of the sort of feedback they could leave in the first paragraph of the copy.</p>



<h2 id="3"><strong>3. Zippi</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.zippi.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zippi</a> is a small, UK-based company that allows you to print and frame your photos (among other things). As with lots of smaller brands—and a lot of large ones, too—it leans on <a href="https://www.feefo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Feefo</a> to power its e-commerce reviews.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="914" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-118461" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-197x300.png 197w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-380x579.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-23x35.png 23w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-33x50.png 33w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-322x490.png 322w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-220x335.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image13-4-385x586.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>This email is a useful example of a survey that deals with the most important thing first—in this case, seeking your overall feedback on the experience of shopping with Zippi.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the big-picture stuff out the way, you can drill down into more specific questions that help you add meaning to the overall verdict.</p>



<h2 id="4"><strong>4. Sports Direct</strong></h2>



<p>Whereas Zippi has partnered with Feefo to generate customer reviews, <a href="https://www.sportsdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sports Direct</a> has gone with another of the big hitters, <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trustpilot</a>.</p>

<p>What’s so great about this email? It may not look flashy, but that simple star-rating graphic is highly impactful.</p>



<p>Visuals are important. Indeed, 33% of us are visual learners, making it the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340450/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most common learning style</a>.</p>



<p>Sports Direct uses this to its advantage, guiding the customer with a visual representation of a “review”. I challenge anyone who receives that email <em>not </em>to click one of the rating boxes.</p>



<h2 id="5"><strong>5. Amazon</strong></h2>



<p><a href="http://amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon’s</a> entire business is built around <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/bezos-says-customer-delight-heart-of-amazon-success-10866159/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delighting customers</a>, so it’s no surprise its e-commerce surveys are so effective.</p>

<p>For instance, maybe there’s only one issue on which you really want <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feedback</a>. Amazon does this by asking for specific insight on how well this product fits because that’s clearly important to shoppers.</p>



<p>If you’ve got a large customer base, you don’t necessarily need to ask every question to every customer. By asking one customer about sizing, one about delivery, and another about comfort, you increase your chances of getting a response (because your survey is so quick and simple), while also generating highly specific feedback.</p>



<h2 id="6"><strong>6. Everlane</strong></h2>



<p>This email demonstrates how it’s not <em>always </em>the right idea to ask the broadest possible question first up; it depends entirely on the goal of your survey.</p>



<p>Your customers are busy. What’s more, they receive a lot of emails. By 2022, we’ll receive an average of <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2018-2022-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">333 business and consumer emails a day</a>, or 14 an hour. It’s exhausting just thinking about it.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s a good idea to give customers a little incentive to complete your survey. <a href="https://www.everlane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Everlane</a> does this by offering shoppers who fill in its survey a chance to win a $200 gift card.</p>



<p>This is a double win. Not only does it make me more likely to give feedback, but it also demonstrates how much Everlane values my opinion and is committed to improving its customer experience.</p>

<p>In this example, MeUndies demonstrates that not all e-commerce surveys have to be specifically linked to a recent purchase. Instead, this email asks for feedback on the company’s <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-loyalty-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">membership program</a>.</p>



<p>The lesson here? Don’t be afraid to reach out to customers who haven’t bought from you in a while, provided you’ve got something worthwhile to ask.</p>



<h2 id="8"><strong>8. Target</strong></h2>



<p>Low review scores are a nightmare for e-commerce brands.

<p><a href="https://www.target.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Target</a> recognizes this—so it urges shoppers to fix any issues <em>before </em>they submit their review.</p>



<p>Sure, you might think Target is “cooking the books” on its review scores here. But there’s nothing wrong with asking customers to give you a chance to fix something before they leave a damaging one-star review.</p>

<p>Not only does it make for an engaging piece of content in its own right, but it also demonstrates how much you care about improving customer experience. Plus it’s an opportunity to sell something—look at all the products referenced in the results.</p>

<p><a href="https://drop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drop</a> takes a clean, uncluttered approach to its e-commerce survey emails. There’s nothing to distract the reader here—just a link to the product, a <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/call-to-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call to action</a> at the top of the email, an image, and the visual cue of a star rating system.</p>



<p>On another note, linking to the product—as Drop does here—can be super effective, too. It helps your customer find it quickly and remind themselves of things like pricing and specifications that they might want to reference in their review.</p>

<p>Obviously, the main reason to send an e-commerce survey is to acquire the data you need to improve your customer experience. But that doesn’t mean you can’t <em>also</em> use it to lay the groundwork for <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-retention-emails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retaining customers</a> and encouraging repeat purchases.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/bellroy-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellroy</a> does here. By positioning a purchase as the start of a journey, rather than a one-off transaction, this survey email paves the way for building a long-term relationship with the customer.</p>



<p>Additionally, the language puts the reader in a positive frame of mind for their review, using phrases like “slimmed your pockets” and “streamlined your things” to reiterate Bellroy’s key features and benefits.</p>



<p>The use of a five-star line-break below the intro text is another nice touch, guiding the customer toward leaving a positive review.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the value of word-of-mouth marketing—something that <a href="https://www.joyus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Joyus</a> clearly recognizes, prompting it to ask the classic <a href="https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-satisfaction-surveys#leverage-an-nps-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPS</a> question: “How likely are you to refer us to a friend?”</p>



<p>By repeating this survey over time, Joyus can gauge whether its actions are making customers more or less likely to recommend the brand.</p>



<p>What’s more, by asking this specific question, customers are encouraged to <em>think about </em>recommending Joyus. Again, it’s a double win.</p>



<h2 id="13"><strong>13. Nokia</strong></h2>

<p>Once the customer understands exactly how long it’ll take to fill out your e-commerce survey, they can decide whether they’ve got time for it right now. That makes them more likely to start (and complete) it.</p>



<p>Research suggests the ideal survey length is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2501/IJMR-2017-039?journalCode=mrea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">10 minutes</a>, so Nokia’s two-minute survey certainly shouldn’t put too many people off.</p>

<p>With this survey example, it manages to take offline interactions online by capturing an email address in-store and sending a feedback survey. That way, it can make customer experience improvements based on feedback from <em>all </em>shoppers, not just those who buy online.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>No one expects you to somehow meld all of these examples into a single e-commerce survey email—that would look terrible and be extremely confusing.</p>



<p>Instead, use them as inspiration for testing multiple approaches over time. See which tactics generate the most insightful results (and which just don’t work for you), and do more of the good stuff.</p>



<p>The more data you capture, the smarter your decision-making will be, which will help you build a better customer experience.</p>

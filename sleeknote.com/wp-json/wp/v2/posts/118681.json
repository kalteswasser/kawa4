A salesman, Joe Ades, shows his product (a carrot slicer) to pedestrians with an energetic attitude and a friendly smile, making him look more approachable and trustworthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He pitches his product directly by showing potential customers how the carrot slicer can help them have an easy peeling experience. Seeing the salesperson peel the carrots so effortlessly, in turn, compels his audience to give the product a try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not do the same in your sales pitches?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Aaron Krause\u2019s Scrubbing Tool Pitch<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Scrub Daddy Pitch (Shark Tank Season 4 Episode 7)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ggi3yfUv0Mo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re an avid follower of Shark Tank, you might already be aware of Aaron Krause\u2019s genius.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Krause, a contestant in Shark Tank, presents his sales pitch for a scrubbing tool that changes texture based on water temperature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the product itself isn\u2019t particularly inspiring, Krause uses his <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/story-based-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">storytelling<\/a> skills to strike a chord with the audience and judges by sharing how he came up with the idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, he supports his claims with a live presentation of how the product solves a common household problem (cleaning), showing the audience how useful his scrubbing tool can be.

In turn, his pitch helped him make many customers believe that spending $8 on a match ticket was more valuable than going to the movies or McDonald\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuban had bought the Mavericks for $280 million.

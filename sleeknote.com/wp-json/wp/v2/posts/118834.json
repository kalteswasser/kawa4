Ditch Unprofitable Keywords<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1\"><strong>1. Start Small, Then Scale Up<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re new to the world of Google Shopping, the best piece of advice I can offer you is to start out with very low bids until you\u2019ve figured out what you\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is, you will<em> <\/em>make mistakes. When you do, they\u2019ll cost you money. So it\u2019s far better to make them when the stakes are low because your bids and budgets are minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s another benefit to this approach, too\u2014it forces you to focus on quality over quantity. If you immediately plow a bunch of money into your ads, you\u2019ll almost certainly bring in a ton of traffic but a lot of that traffic won\u2019t convert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you force yourself to stick to a tight budget, you\u2019ll have to be highly efficient to get eyes on your products. You\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/email-click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">maximize click-through rates<\/a> (CTRs), control your bidding to improve profit margins and reduce bounce rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you\u2019ll be bringing in a small but steady stream of quality traffic, not a flash-flood of irrelevant shoppers looking for stuff you don\u2019t even sell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve reached that point, you can turn up the tap by increasing your bids and budgets because you know what you\u2019re doing is effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\"><strong>2. Nail Your Campaign Structure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCampaign structure\u201d is one of the biggest ways you can level up the performance of your Google Shopping campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain why structure matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most basic campaign structure would look like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1x campaign<\/li><li>1x ad group<\/li><li>1x product group<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s a problem with this approach. Because there\u2019s just a solitary product group, you\u2019re bidding exactly the same amount for every click\u2014no matter the search query or product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be happy paying \u20ac1+ per click for high-ticket items like my beloved Rolex, but what if your imaginary watch emporium also sells low-price products, like those springy bars that attach the strap to the lug? (Yes, \u201clug\u201d is the right word, I googled it.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They only cost a couple of euros, so your bids need to be a lot lower, otherwise, you\u2019ll lose money with every click.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have one bid for all product types. So you need to build multiple product groups, based on criteria like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Brand;<\/li><li>Product type; and<\/li><li>Item ID.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to use custom labels to factor in more granular information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you\u2019re in a world where you can set different bid levels based on factors like sales volume and profit margin. So if you sell two types of watch strap spring bar at \u20ac3 apiece, but one makes you a profit of \u20ac2 and the other only makes you \u20ac1.50, you can set your bids accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a general rule, if you\u2019re not sure how to structure your campaigns, you\u2019re best off replicating the structure of your e-commerce store, with different campaigns for different <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-category-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">product categories<\/a>, subcategories, and brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Optimize Your Product Imagery<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google relies on the imagery provided by retailers to populate its shopping adverts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your imagery isn\u2019t up to scratch, people aren\u2019t going to click your ads. What\u2019s more, Google understands shoppers want to see quality imagery, so it actively <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6142776?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blocks campaigns<\/a> if the visuals aren\u2019t good enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meaning, you need to improve the standard of your product imagery before you\u2019re ready to start advertising on Google Shopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Google is crystal clear about how it wants your <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/product-photography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">product photos<\/a> to look. Images should:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be set against a solid, light-colored background.<\/strong> White or light gray are best.<\/li><li><strong>Be clearly and evenly lit.<\/strong> Google Shopping is no place for artsy lighting.<\/li><li><strong>Show the product at the right scale. <\/strong>It shouldn\u2019t be too big or too small, and should take up 75-90 percent of the full image.<\/li><li><strong>Not be overly edited. <\/strong>Steer clear of blurring, pixelation, and vignetting your imagery. It might look pretty, but it doesn\u2019t help shoppers get a clear view of the product.<\/li><li><strong>Clearly depict the product being sold. <\/strong>Close-ups and rear views are fine as supplementary images but don\u2019t use them as the main image.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond these specific rules, there are a few other best practices you should follow with your product imagery where relevant:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try to show off clothing products on-body;<\/li><li>Provide multiple angles; and<\/li><li>Depict real people wearing or using it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. Use Negative Keywords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time someone clicks your Google Shopping Ads, it costs you money. So the last thing you want is for some of those clicks to be wasted on people who weren\u2019t even looking for the product you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to my Rolex example. (Maybe if I mention them enough times, they\u2019ll send me a free one.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, your e-commerce store exclusively sells brand new Yacht-Master watches. That means you definitely wouldn\u2019t want your Shopping ads to show up on searches like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Used Rolex Yacht-Master<\/li><li>Refurbished Rolex Yacht-Master<\/li><li>Second-hand Rolex Yacht-Master<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also want to steer clear of terms like \u201ccheap Rolex Yacht-Master\u201d or \u201cRolex Yacht-Master deals\u201d, plus comparison searches such as \u201cRolex Yacht-Master alternatives\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re only targeting the term \u201cRolex Yacht-Master\u201d, you could appear in every one of those searches, despite them being irrelevant to your store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution? <em>Negative keywords.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trawl through your search terms report and look out for the following types of <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/keyword-mapping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keywords<\/a> to exclude:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Competitor terms: <\/strong>Branded queries incorporating your competitors\u2019 names. It can be tempting to bid on rival brands, but it\u2019s often expensive and rarely effective.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Irrelevant terms: <\/strong>You don\u2019t want to be bidding on queries for products you don\u2019t sell, or for things that aren\u2019t even products.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Extremely generic terms: <\/strong>Sure, you sell watches. But your Rolex store is unlikely to generate a lot of sales from people searching the term \u201cwatches\u201d.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Out-of-stock or unlaunched products: <\/strong>If you don\u2019t have the Yacht-Master 42 in stock, there\u2019s no point bidding for it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Purge your account of terms like these by adding them as negative keywords, then you can expect to see healthy upticks in CTR, conversion rate, and return on ad spend (ROAS).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. Monitor for Product Overlap<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say your e-commerce store doesn\u2019t exclusively sell Rolex Yacht-Master watches and accessories. You sell other Rolexes, too, plus products from a bunch of other watchmakers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that case, you could be running dozens, or even hundreds, of different campaigns simultaneously. This means there\u2019s a good chance some of your products are appearing in multiple campaigns. That\u2019s bad news and here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, you have a product that appears in two different campaigns:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Campaign one<\/strong> has a ROAS target of 500 percent<\/li><li><strong>Campaign two<\/strong> has a ROAS target of 1,000 percent<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, you\u2019re bidding against yourself and because Google settles for the lower<em> <\/em>target, <strong>campaign two<\/strong> is going to beat <strong>campaign one <\/strong>for that duplicated product. As a result, you\u2019ll make less money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6. Craft Engaging Product Titles<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve already noted, imagery is extremely important to the performance of your Google Shopping Ads. <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/pricing-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pricing<\/a> is another crucial factor\u2014if you\u2019re selling the same product as someone else but at twice the price, good luck winning those clicks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s one more element that\u2019s too important to ignore: your <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/product-headlines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">product titles<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more relevant and engaging your titles, the higher your CTR will be, and the better your campaign will perform. But how do you tell if your product titles are <em>good?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, we don\u2019t have to guess. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.storegrowers.com\/product-title-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Store Growers<\/a>, a specialist in <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/how-to-use-google-adwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Ads for e-commerce<\/a>, analyzed 151 product titles from 120 different advertisers across 13 industries, and identified the following best practices:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep product titles to the optimal length. <\/strong>Google allows titles of up to 150 characters, but sticking to 75-100 characters works best.<\/li><li><strong>Write numbers as digits. <\/strong>Write \u201c7\u201d instead of \u201cseven\u201d. 97 percent of top advertisers do this.<\/li><li><strong>Capitalize product titles. <\/strong>97 percent of top advertisers use this technique.<\/li><li><strong>Use symbols for ease of reading. <\/strong>70 percent of top advertisers use symbols like hyphens (-), forward slashes (\/), vertical lines (|), and commas (,) to make product titles easier to digest.<\/li><li><strong>Add extra (relevant) keywords. <\/strong>This tip is used by 32 percent of top advertisers.<\/li><li><strong>Include your brand name. <\/strong>This one\u2019s most relevant to brands, rather than retailers that stock a range of brands. Still, 44 percent of top advertisers do it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7. Ditch Unprofitable Keywords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pareto Principle\u2014otherwise known as the 80\/20 Rule\u2014declares that most things in life aren\u2019t distributed evenly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Esteemed economist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/1\/80-20-rule.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vilfredo Pareto<\/a> formulated his principle from the observation that 80 percent of land in Italy was owned by 20 percent of the population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it applies to a lot of other things, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of Google Shopping, you\u2019ll likely notice that a small subset of keywords is driving a high proportion of your returns. It\u2019s in your interest to trawl through your account, identify the biggest \u201closers\u201d, and mark them as excluded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of reasons why you might want to exclude a certain keyword. For instance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It\u2019s out of season: <\/strong>You\u2019re not going to sell a lot of chunky parkas at the height of summer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It\u2019s out of stock: <\/strong>If you don\u2019t have it, you can\u2019t sell it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It\u2019s only available in obscure sizes or colors: <\/strong>If you\u2019ve only got a t-shirt left in XXXL with a hot pink colorway, it might be time to exclude that keyword.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e9ff85a7a3a4\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\"><\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 12 CRO resources to help you drive more leads and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for satisfaction guarantee examples or product page examples, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 23+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of experts like to make Google Shopping sound extremely complicated, but it really isn\u2019t rocket science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, there are some technical elements and complex terminology to get your head around.

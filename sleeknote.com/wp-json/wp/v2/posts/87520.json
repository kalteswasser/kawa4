However, you also know that most of your traffic won\u2019t translate into sales right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That\u2019s where email popups come in.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a persuasive <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/email-popup-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email popup<\/a>, you can turn first-time visitors into subscribers, and convince them to buy from you through <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-email-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are two proven methods you can use for that goal, regardless of industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1\"><strong>1. Run a Giveaway<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Giveaways<\/a> are among marketers\u2019 favorite tools for a good reason. They help you collect leads interested in your products and services (given that your prize is relevant to your brand.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, giveaways are popular because they\u2019re proven, cost-effective ways of collecting emails on your site in no time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giveaways with attractive prizes give first-time visitors a compelling reason to submit their email address without breaking the bank for you. Plus, they work for every business type and industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, you\u2019re an e-commerce manager, wanting to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/list-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\">grow your email list<\/a>. You could host an on-site giveaway, promising a top-selling product or a gift card to be redeemed on your store, and promote it with a popup.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f6dd7d02682e\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Giveaway-Popup.png\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

Using a timed trigger, you can set your popup to show after a visitor spends eight seconds on your site. (Hint:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/popup-statistics\">our data suggests<\/a>&nbsp;that eight is the magical number.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"386\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Eight-Seconds-Trigger.gif\" alt=\"Eight Seconds Trigger\" class=\"wp-image-99349\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2\"><strong>2. Offer a Lead Magnet<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One trap many marketers fall into is welcoming new visitors with an overly salesy popup. Keep in mind that at this stage, the visitor likely doesn\u2019t know or even care about you. That\u2019s why they immediately reach for the close button, or worse, leave your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this stage of the buyer\u2019s journey, prospects have a problem in mind, and they\u2019re looking for a solution online, be it the prettiest summer dress or the most user-friendly email service provider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a valuable <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/evergreen-lead-magnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lead magnet<\/a>, you can offer your new visitors the answer as a free resource. Lead magnets not only show your expertise in the area, but they also open up opportunities for incorporating <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/product-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">product marketing<\/a> into your resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In e-commerce, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-lead-magnets\" target=\"_blank\">lead magnets<\/a> can come in any form: a free guide on skincare, a PDF file packed with decoration tips, a short blog post on how to wear transitional jackets. Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f6dd7fe2682f\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Free-Guide-Popup.png\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see? Load this high-converting template in our editor and customize it to the look and feel of your business.<\/p>\n            <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/template-signup\/?templateId=Black-and-White-Giveaway&#038;goalId=newsletter\">Try it out<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For SaaS or B2B companies, whitepapers, eBooks, free guides, and email courses work like a charm. Take this example from our website:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Offer-a-Lead-Magnet.svg\" alt=\"Offer a Lead Magnet\" class=\"wp-image-118560\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is, you don\u2019t necessarily need a blog or YouTube channel to create relevant content around the problems your brand is solving. Make sure to stay helpful to your prospects, whether or not they buy from you, and present it with a <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/popup-design-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">well-designed email popup<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-grey-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3>Pro Tip:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever strategy you choose, remember to hide your email popup from existing subscribers. Otherwise, you\u2019ll annoy them by asking the same question over and over again. (One that they\u2019ve already said yes to.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"361\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Newsletter-Subscriber.gif\" alt=\"Newsletter-Subscriber\" class=\"wp-image-99373\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Goal 2: Guide Visitors to Better Buying Decisions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a struggle familiar to all online businesses: You want to assist your website visitors the best way possible, but you also know it\u2019s tough recreating the face-to-face experience. For that purpose, you might a live chat box to your site, then a \u201ccontact us\u201d plugin, and a survey extension on top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, while trying to help your visitors, you often end up overwhelming them with too many messages, coupled with bad timing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are two smarter ways to guide your visitors to better buying decisions by showing them the popups they need, at the perfect time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Offer Help When Needed<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re running an online store or a B2B business, you should give your visitors a helping hand, especially if your products are complicated or have a longer buying cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you offer prospects help and act as their personalized shopping assistant, you improve the user experience and increase visitors\u2019 likelihood of purchasing your products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In e-commerce, a helpful popup is typically a size guide, relevant <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/product-recommendations\" target=\"_blank\">product recommendations<\/a>, or contact information.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f6dd82c26830\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Size-Guide-Popup.png\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

Show your popups at these times, and you\u2019ll be helpful without hurting the user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-grey-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3>Pro Tip:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to show your popup after a visitor has seen, for example, three pages on your site, you can set up a targeting option that works only when the visitor fulfills this condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"359\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Pages-Visited-Condition.gif\" alt=\"Pages Visited Condition\" class=\"wp-image-99389\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4\"><strong>4.

Offer Limited-Time Deals<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first big idea here is to offer visitors special deals, be it discounts, free shipping, or product bundles, but only for a <em>limited time<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/limited-time-offers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">limited-time offers<\/a> in your popups, you can highlight the <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/limited-time-offers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scarcity<\/a> of the offer, and therefore, drive urgency to your sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you can make prospects take action more quickly and increase your sales without hurting profits by, for example, discounting for a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re an e-commerce marketer, you can create a free shipping code that works for the weekend only and drive urgency in your popup, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f6dd88626832\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Free-Shipping-Popup.png\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

It also means that you need to be there when visitors have a question or concern in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next are two ways to connect with your visitors through popups without distracting them from your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7\"><strong>7. Invite Prospects to Contact You<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When used right, a contact popup can act as an attentive salesperson who answers visitors\u2019 questions and helps them pick the right products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you should, at all times, make it clear on your site <em>how <\/em>and <em>where <\/em>visitors can contact you. But, the problem with this approach is that not all businesses offer 24\/7 customer service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you ask visitors to call you on a number when your support team is already home, you\u2019ll only disappoint them, or worse, make them move on to a competitor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the big idea that works for every business type is, <em>create two contact popups that show at different times.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this example. During office hours, you can use a popup that invites visitors to call your support team:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your support team is out of office (and on weekends,) you can show a popup that collects visitors\u2019 questions, instead:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Create-Two-Contact-Popups-That-Show-at-Different-Times.svg\" alt=\"Create Two Contact Popups That Show at Different Times\" class=\"wp-image-118566\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, visitors can always know the best way to contact you, and you can remove any obstacles to buying without increasing your customer support costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-grey-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3>Pro Tip:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Set up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/features\/advanced-scheduling\">repeating schedule<\/a>&nbsp;to automatically activate and deactivate your popups ahead of time.

But, if you\u2019re like most marketers, you likely struggle with <em>when <\/em>and <em>whom <\/em>to ask your questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My suggestion is to use popups that show at the right time, and to one segment of visitors (returning subscribers, one-time buyers, and so on.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of hiding your surveys on your website and expecting people to find it, you can turn it into an ongoing, automated process with timely popups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re running an online store, try asking your questions after customers complete their purchase:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f6dd8e026834\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Survey-Popup.png\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

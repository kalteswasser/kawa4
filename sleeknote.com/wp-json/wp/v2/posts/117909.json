In fact, they are signs that it\u2019s time to use your secret weapon: win-back emails. Win-back emails are designed specially to re-engage inactive subscribers in a number of ways. And they work:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/marketingland.com\/email-win-back-programs-work-81574&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614777976770000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dHoX6X_uFajKkD0EP1RpW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">45 percent of subscribers<\/a>&nbsp;who receive a win-back email will go on to open future emails from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not simply invest in new customers instead? Surely they\u2019ll be easier to convince? Well, it turns out that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/customer-acquisition-retention\/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614777976771000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3aND0LKHLd9xv-oWWw4mvF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">probability that an existing customer will make a purchase from you<\/a>&nbsp;is around 60\u201370 percent, while the likelihood of selling to a new prospect is only around 5\u201320 percent. You do the math.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many ways to approach a win back email, so here are seven examples of emails from brands winning back their subscribers left, right and center. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of pointing out exactly what each one did right, so you can build a successful win back campaign for your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e6f406d8dc96\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\">Free Downloadable Bonus<\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Email Marketing Inspiration?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 11 email marketing resources to help you make more from your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for good email examples or evergreen email subject lines, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 24+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Email Marketing Inspiration?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h.kjag3si84h0h\"><strong>Table of Contents<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#1\">1.

Or maybe your product range didn\u2019t catch their eye back then, and they haven\u2019t had a chance to see all of your new and exciting additions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s where a little refresher can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an opportunity to remind your subscribers of exactly what your brand is all about, and what you have to offer right now. That could mean your USPs and brand message, or perhaps a showcase of your latest products and content, just like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/lastobject.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614777976772000&amp;usg=AOvVaw232Jn96TVjIHr6Pxyl83Yv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LastObject<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"753\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-753x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117914\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-753x1024.png 753w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-768x1044.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-380x517.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-600x816.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-760x1033.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-26x35.png 26w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-37x50.png 37w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-360x490.png 360w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-220x299.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3-385x523.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image9-3.png 991w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Right away, they get to the heart of the matter: you\u2019ve been an inactive subscriber and you probably haven\u2019t seen all the new things they\u2019ve been up to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start off with, there are two articles from their blog on how to lead a zero-waste, sustainable lifestyle. These immediately engage you with their core brand values of eco-friendliness, sustainability and activism, making it about more than just sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, they give you a taste of their expanding product range. LastObject is probably most well-known for it\u2019s reusable LastSwab, which went viral on social media a while back, and so it\u2019s likely that many of their subscribers are unaware of their new innovations. This email hopes to change that, with quick descriptions and CTAs to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"991\" height=\"896\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117916\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3.png 991w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-300x271.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-768x694.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-380x344.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-600x542.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-760x687.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-39x35.png 39w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-55x50.png 55w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-542x490.png 542w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-220x199.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-3-385x348.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Refresher emails are a way to remind your subscribers why they joined your mailing list in the first place and keep your brand fresh in their mind, without the need for a discount or coupon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they aren\u2019t being overly salesy or aggressive. Like LastObject, it\u2019s important that your email nudges rather than demands, with low-friction CTAs and engaging copy. It\u2019s also important that you keep these kinds of emails up-to-date, so you can keep showcasing your latest ideas and improvements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\"><strong>2. The Product Recommendation Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One possible pain point for inactive subscribers is that your product catalog is simply too much to look through and there is just not enough time in the day. We\u2019re all busy people, after all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can smooth out this wrinkle by going a step beyond and providing them with product recommendations, sorting through your product range to find things that will really appeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a myriad of ways to go about recommending products to subscribers, including seasonal gift guides or more personalized recommendations based on their recent browsing- or click-history. Alternatively, you can think a little outside the box, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.asics.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614777976774000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2IeUybz-F7i19j6YzRRnV4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Asics<\/a>&nbsp;does in this email:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"790\" height=\"542\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117917\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding which shoes are best for which activities can be difficult and a little overwhelming. That\u2019s why Asics have developed a quiz that customers can use to find out exactly which shoes suit their needs best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, they\u2019re not overloading the email with shoes for different possible scenarios but putting the power into the hands of the subscriber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By including this in their win-back email, they\u2019re acknowledging their subscribers\u2019 problems and providing an easy solution, one that clears the road to make their journey to purchase easier and more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. The Social Proof Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another potential reason that is stopping your subscribers from engaging with you is that hearing everything from you directly just isn\u2019t enough. Of course, you know your brand better than anyone, but hearing good things from others is often the push people need to make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social proof is the idea that we have more faith in things that have been tried out and enjoyed by others, and it can be communicated in several ways. Think reviews, ratings, testimonials, endorsements, you name it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614777976775000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VLWy_quXvAZ4mgK25I1So\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Warby Parker<\/a>, the online prescription glasses store, fill their email with tweets from satisfied customers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"739\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-739x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117919\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-739x1024.png 739w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-216x300.png 216w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-768x1065.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-380x527.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-600x832.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-760x1054.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-25x35.png 25w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-36x50.png 36w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-353x490.png 353w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-220x305.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3-385x534.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-3.png 1007w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Competing against well-established high street brands comes with many challenges, and Warby Parker use these Twitter testimonials as social proof of their high-quality products and services that rival any competitors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be one thing to list off these benefits themselves, but having their customers say it for them packs a much bigger punch. For a subscriber, learning that other customers think highly enough of a brand to write a tweet or leave a review may just tip the scales enough for them to open your emails and see what you\u2019re all about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. The Incentive Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah yes, the incentive email \u2013 the win back email that every brand thinks of and yet is reluctant to send out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Well, while discounts and coupons can be highly effective at re-engaging subscribers and customers, there are also times where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/blog\/abandoned-cart-coupon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">they can do more harm than good<\/a>. The trick is to know when to use them, and exactly what to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving incentives to entice inactive subscribers back to the fold doesn\u2019t have to be your first or only option, but adding the right kind to your win-back email sequence can tempt back a price-conscious shopper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty product subscription service Birchbox added a percentage discount offer in their end-of-year win-back email, which Seray recently received:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"722\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-722x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-722x1024.png 722w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-211x300.png 211w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-768x1090.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-380x539.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-600x851.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-760x1078.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-25x35.png 25w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-35x50.png 35w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-345x490.png 345w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-220x312.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3-385x546.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-3.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as using the new year as a way to persuade Seray to try out their service, they also offered her a coupon code for 50 percent off her first subscription box with a 6-month sign-up, which sounds a pretty big deal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its long but personal copy and the enclosed offer, this email may well have been an effective tactic for them.

Receiving an extra item alongside your order can potentially build much more excitement than simply saving a little money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other enticing incentives could include \u2018dollar-amount\u2019 discounts, which <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/email-win-back-programs-work-81574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tend to perform better than percentage discounts<\/a>, free shipping, extra loyalty program points, and sweepstakes. You could also try out incorporating limited-time offers into your win-back emails, to add some urgency into the mix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. The Feedback Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can spend hours trying to work out why your subscribers aren\u2019t engaging with your emails like you hoped, but doesn\u2019t it make sense to ask them directly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback emails are commonplace for many other purposes, in marketing and beyond, and they are ideal for finding out exactly how to fine-tune your email strategy and re-engage your subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at this email from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.provenskincare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Proven<\/a> for inspiration:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"859\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-859x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117923\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-859x1024.png 859w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-252x300.png 252w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-768x916.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-380x453.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-600x716.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-760x906.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-29x35.png 29w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-42x50.png 42w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-411x490.png 411w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-220x262.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3-385x459.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image8-3.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While this was sent as an abandoned cart email, it shares many qualities with what you think of as a win back email: a customer liked their brand, but something stopped them from fully engaging and completing a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This email comes across as totally sincere, giving a number of legitimate reasons that may have stopped you from checking out. It also gives you them directly in the email, rather than providing a link to a survey in another tab. This kind of email quickly makes subscribers feel heard and appreciated, especially when given the option to voice their questions or concerns directly to a human being. This feeling of being valued as a subscriber may be enough to start them engaging with your brand once more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A win back email asking for feedback could also be easily combined with an incentive for filling out a form or survey, to encourage even the more disengaged subscriber to open the email and give their thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6. The Last Chance Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the fear of losing something is a much more powerful motivator than the prospect of gaining something. In psychological terms, this is called loss aversion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the scenario: your emails have been arriving in your subscriber\u2019s inbox, only for them to look at them all and think \u2018later\u2019. This happens over and over again, until one day, an email arrives telling them that if they don\u2019t click through, they\u2019ll be unsubscribed in 30 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the last chance win back email, and its benefits are twofold. Firstly, those who are afraid of losing your presence in their inbox will click to remain subscribed, and you have another chance to engage them with a catchy campaign. Second, if they do really want to end the relationship, then you clean your email list of an inactive subscriber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This email from <a href=\"https:\/\/tattly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tattly<\/a> is a great example of how to formulate a last chance email:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"951\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117924\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2.png 924w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-291x300.png 291w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-768x790.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-380x391.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-600x618.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-760x782.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-34x35.png 34w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-49x50.png 49w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-476x490.png 476w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-220x226.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-2-385x396.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a touch of humor and halloween spirit for the month of October, Tattly succinctly spells out the situation and what to do to fix it. It\u2019s simple, easy to understand, and likeable enough to encourage their subscribers to click that big red button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important aspect to get right in an email like this is to avoid guilt trips at all costs. Nothing makes a person switch off from a brand faster than being made to feel bad during their interactions. Keeping this message light leaves a door open for your subscribers to tune back in to your emails at a later, more convenient time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to leave the door open could be to include an option to receive fewer emails from you instead. Some of your subscribers may appreciate hearing about your new products every so often, but don\u2019t want to be notified about every single sale you put on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7. The Unsubscribe Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\u2019ve sent your inactive subscribers a well thought out sequence of win back emails, attempting to entice them with everything from gift guides to customer reviews, even your latest blog content. But still no opens or click-throughs&#8230;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the kindest thing to do may be to let go. After all, if you love something, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proactively removing inactive subscribers from your email list has several benefits, including reducing the number of people marking your emails as spam and increasing your lead quality and conversion rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the way that LastObject goes about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"950\" height=\"769\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117925\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3.png 950w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-300x243.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-768x622.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-380x308.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-600x486.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-760x615.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-43x35.png 43w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-62x50.png 62w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-605x490.png 605w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-220x178.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-3-385x312.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This email doesn\u2019t take up any more time than it needs to. It\u2019s short and to-the-point, yet the copy isn\u2019t harsh or dismissive. They let you know why you\u2019re being unsubscribed and that there\u2019s no hard feelings involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also include that all-important CTA to resubscribe, just in case you get cold feet at the very last second, and mention that you can resubscribe later if that suits you better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing a little empathy towards your subscribers and their overflowing inboxes can go a long way. It\u2019s important to understand that they may not be in the place to read your emails or purchase from you right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is over forever. There may well come a time when your brand is perfect for them, and leaving on a positive note could make all the difference.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e6f406d8dc96\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\">Free Downloadable Bonus<\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Email Marketing Inspiration?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 11 email marketing resources to help you make more from your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for good email examples or evergreen email subject lines, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 24+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Email Marketing Inspiration?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Winning back disengaged subscribers is not the easiest task.

Do they need help getting started? Do they have ideas for new developments? Show them that you care about them and that you are interested in hearing what they have to say.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Value doesn\u2019t have to be a free gift or a discount, it can just as easily be you offering to be available and telling your new subscribers that you value them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an example from our email onboarding flow where we encourage users to engage with our product and get even better results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"729\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email.jpg\" alt=\"Best Practice Email\" class=\"wp-image-72951\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-247x300.jpg 247w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-380x462.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-29x35.jpg 29w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-41x50.jpg 41w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-403x490.jpg 403w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-220x267.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Best-Practice-Email-385x468.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sleeknote, we believe praising our users when they achieve great results is an important part of reducing churn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We segment our emails based on event triggers and conversion rates which means every email we send is relevant to the person who receives it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, when a user has a conversion rate above 3 percent, we send them the above email telling them how great they\u2019re doing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This email has a click-through rate of 28 percent which is a great indicator that these emails increase engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we invite users to chat with one of our experts to help increase their conversion rates further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These emails provide value to both our users and us.

Stay on top of new developments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one can be tricky and it requires a bit more effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, staying on top of new developments, rules, laws, shift in consumer behavior, and other environmental changes needs to be done if you want to reduce your churn rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New developments happen all the time, and you never know when it\u2019s going to have an effect on your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/mobile-friendly-popup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google announced in August 2016<\/a> that they would start to punish websites with intrusive interstitials by January 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This potentially could have created a very negative effect on the use of our product and our churn rate, had we not already started developing a new product that could meet these requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we had not kept up with new developments and not listened to our customers, we might not have had a product ready in time for the new regulations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could just as easily happen to any other e-commerce business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you sell pet food, and an animal rights organization announces that they no longer support the use of a specific ingredient in pet food because it can have a negative effect on animals\u2019 health, could do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could announce that you\u2019ve stopped using this ingredient and that you\u2019re working on a new and better recipe for pet food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, you can\u2019t always fully plan for disruptions, but if you stay on top of the game, and take immediate action when it happens, you\u2019ll undoubtedly reduce the likelihood of customer churn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6.

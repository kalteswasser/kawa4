Make Your Site Easy to Buy From<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1\"><strong>1. Figure Out What a Lead Looks Like<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think when you hear the phrase \u201clead generation\u201d? Most likely, you\u2019re imagining a B2B company selling a solution. In that context, a \u201clead\u201d is a person whose name, job title, and contact information you pass on to your sales team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have captured that information after they downloaded a piece of gated content, or registered for a webinar. Over time, your sales reps will nurture those leads, sending them case studies and other relevant content, with the ultimate goal of booking a product demo and closing the deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That whole process could take weeks or months. And, particularly for enterprise-level sales, it will likely involve multiple decision-makers on the buyer\u2019s side. E-commerce lead generation is totally different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because the path to purchase is so much shorter. I\u2019m not the most compulsive buyer in the world, but if I want a new shirt, I\u2019m not going to agonize over it for several weeks and ask my accountant for sign-off\u2014I\u2019ll find one I like, then I\u2019ll buy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the word \u201clead\u201d has a different meaning in an e-commerce context. In fact, there are two distinct types of e-commerce leads:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Target lead:<\/strong> Simply put, this is <em>anyone <\/em>who\u2019s likely to buy something from you.<\/li><li><strong>Marketing lead: <\/strong>This is someone whose contact information you\u2019ve acquired. That means you can communicate with them and drive them toward buying from you in future.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do those different types of leads look like in practice? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a sportswear brand. Your target leads could include gym-goers, amateur (and maybe even professional) sportspeople, runners, climbers, hikers\u2026 the list goes on. Marketing leads would be any of those people who\u2019ve given you their contact details, such as by signing up for your newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By necessity, e-commerce target leads will almost always be more top-level than for a \u201ctraditional\u201d (i.e. B2B) leads-focused business. If you\u2019re selling a SaaS product for hundreds or thousands of euros a month, you\u2019ll likely only deal with a relatively small number of leads, and you\u2019ll want to know as much about those people as possible so you can build <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/b2b-personalization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highly personalized campaigns<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s just not applicable to most e-commerce businesses. You likely don\u2019t make enough money from each transaction to justify deep personalization, so you\u2019ll be painting with broader brush strokes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your task at this stage is to figure out what your target leads look like. Maybe you have just two or three; perhaps you have a dozen or more. Define those personas, then document everything you know about them\u2014as a minimum, this should include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Age ranges<\/li><li>Gender<\/li><li>Location<\/li><li>Purchasing power<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\"><strong>2. Optimize Your Landing Pages<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perceived wisdom holds that B2B marketers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/measuring-b2bs-digital-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lag behind their B2C peers<\/a>. That B2C marketers are always pushing the boundaries, while B2Bs are content to rely on the same old tactics. But that\u2019s not always the case. One area in which B2B often leads the way is <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-landing-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the B2B realm, every visitor could potentially be worth tens of thousands of euros. When the stakes are so high, every landing page must be optimized toward generating leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same pressure doesn\u2019t exist in B2C. Unfortunately, this is reflected in the quality of a lot of e-commerce landing pages, which are often nothing more than a list of products scrolling to infinity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, but not always. There are some exceptional examples of e-commerce landing pages that draw the user in and compel them to take action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online wine retailer Winc, which describes itself as the world&#8217;s fastest-growing winery, is one brand that gets it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"483\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-1024x483.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-1024x483.png 1024w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-300x142.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-768x362.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-380x179.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-600x283.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-760x359.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-74x35.png 74w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-106x50.png 106w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-740x349.png 740w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-220x104.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5-385x182.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-5.png 1265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its homepage is laid out like an engaging lead capture form.

Hey presto, they\u2019ve captured another marketing lead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Offer Live Chat Functionality<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like live chat has gone from a \u201cnice to have\u201d to an absolute essential pretty much overnight. That\u2019s because unlike some customer experience \u201cinnovations\u201d I could name, people <em>actually like <\/em>chatbots. Just consider these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/live-chat-customer-support\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">two stats<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Three-quarters of consumers say they find live chat to be the most satisfying way to communicate with a business<\/li><li>Three-fifths of consumers are more likely to return to a website that offers live chat<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why\u2019s it so popular? Because it\u2019s a quick, convenient way to get answers to your shopping-related questions. We all know how frustrating it feels to find a product we want to buy <em>right now<\/em>, only to learn we can\u2019t track down a crucial piece of information about how it fits, or where it can be delivered to, or whether it\u2019s compatible with a different product you own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some brands, live chat can be an effective way to support and engage visitors from the moment they hit your website. It lets you strike up a conversation, answer questions, discern the consumer\u2019s specific needs, and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fireclay Tile does this well. Unless you\u2019re a builder, tiles likely aren\u2019t something you buy every day (or even every decade). So the moment you land on the site, that reassuring live chat box pops up, holding your hand through the path to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-1024x499.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117974\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-1024x499.png 1024w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-768x374.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-380x185.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-600x292.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-760x370.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-72x35.png 72w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-103x50.png 103w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-740x360.png 740w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-220x107.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5-385x188.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image5-5.png 1427w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But for other brands, this sort of immediacy feels like overkill. If I\u2019m buying a pair of socks, I don\u2019t need a chatbot to help me do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse gets the balance right. When you arrive on its homepage, there\u2019s not a chatbot in sight. But click through to the pay-monthly deals page\u2014where purchases are far more complex than simply choosing a device and adding to a bag\u2014and you\u2019re instantly offered the chance to live chat with an expert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-1024x450.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117975\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-1024x450.png 1024w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-300x132.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-768x338.png 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-380x167.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-600x264.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-760x334.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-80x35.png 80w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-114x50.png 114w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-740x326.png 740w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-220x97.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5-385x169.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image6-5.png 1364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. Generate More Reviews<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/customer-testimonials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customer reviews<\/a> matter. How much?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, just 48 percent of consumers say they\u2019d buy from a business with a review score <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lower than four stars<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you\u2019ve already earned a bunch of great reviews, so it\u2019s no longer a focus for your business. But you can\u2019t afford to rest on your laurels, because 73 percent of consumers only pay attention to reviews written <em>in the last month<\/em>. In other words, if your reviews are out of date, they\u2019re not doing you much good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need reviews, and you need to generate them regularly. But you don\u2019t want to spend all your time on it\u2014you\u2019ve got a lot of other priorities. What you need is a passive, scalable way to bring in a consistent stream of reviews. In short, you need <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-email-automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">automation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automating the process of review generation means that every time someone buys from you, they\u2019ll be asked to review your product. Review platforms like Feefo can do this for you, automatically emailing customers within days of them making a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"916\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117976\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-197x300.png 197w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-380x580.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-23x35.png 23w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-33x50.png 33w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-321x490.png 321w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-220x336.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-4-385x588.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going to do it yourself rather than through Feefo (or an alternative), ensure you make it as simple as possible for customers to leave you a glowing review. Remind them what they bought, and direct them straight to the review page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. Create Content at All Stages of the Sales Funnel<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk about creating content for the top, middle, and bottom of the sales funnel, we often envisage B2B marketing, because the sales cycle is so much longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this strategy is still super relevant to the e-commerce space. Consumers still want very different things at each stage of the funnel\u2014it\u2019s just that those stages are a lot more condensed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Top of the funnel:<\/strong> A shopper first becomes aware of their need. Maybe they\u2019ve just been invited to a party. They need a new outfit, so they search for inspiration around fashion trends.<\/li><li><strong>Middle of the funnel: <\/strong>They\u2019ve found something they like. Maybe it\u2019s a style of dress, or a jacket, or a pair of shoes. Now, they want to shop around for options.<\/li><li><strong>Bottom of the funnel:<\/strong> They\u2019re ready to buy. Now, you need to convince them that you\u2019re the right brand to buy from. Maybe they\u2019ll look up returns information, read your reviews, or search for a discount code.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a pretty simplistic end-to-end view of the B2C e-commerce buyer journey. Each of those steps could take no more than a few minutes. In reality, not every shopper will pass through all three stages. Some might leap straight to stage three. Others might start at one, get to two, then bounce right back to one again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t necessarily need to predict every possible path to conversion. Instead, focus on getting all the right content in place so you\u2019re prepared for all types of user journeys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6. Build a Sense of Urgency<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NTWRK, a live stream shopping app, <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/ntwrk-made-over-100000-selling-goods-via-snapchat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made over $100,000 in 24 hours<\/a> by selling limited-edition platinum money counters created by celebrity jeweler Ben Baller. At $250 apiece, that equivalates to more than 400 units sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why did this work? Because urgency is one of the most powerful ways to generate leads and convert them into sales. That\u2019s true in all industries, not just e-commerce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s doubtful that 400+ people all felt a pressing need to buy a platinum money counter at the same time. But because this was a limited-time, never-to-be-repeated offer, the event generated a lot of hype\u2014and that hype led to sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not saying you need to start selling $250 platinum money counters yourself. Whatever your product, you can absolutely create a sense of urgency around it.<br>Fashion e-commerce giant ASOS does this well. Its newsletters are packed full of time-limited offers that prompt consumers to browse and buy <em>right now<\/em>, not in a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"674\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117977\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5.png 680w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-300x297.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-380x377.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-600x595.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-35x35.png 35w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-50x50.png 50w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-494x490.png 494w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-220x218.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-385x382.png 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-5-120x120.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7. Make Your Site Easy to Buy From<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This point should sound obvious, yet it constantly surprises me how many e-commerce stores are <em>difficult to buy from. <\/em>Calls to action are unclear. Key information is hidden or missing. Currencies don\u2019t automatically convert based on the shopper\u2019s location. It\u2019s so frustrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make matters worse, consumers have high expectations. In fact, 80% will <a href=\"https:\/\/searchnode.com\/blog\/coronavirus-aftermath-for-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leave an online store<\/a> that doesn\u2019t offer convenient navigation, relevant search, or clear product information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like that, all your lead gen efforts are wasted, simply because it\u2019s too hard for people to find what they\u2019re looking for on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\u2019s a worry that just 9% of e-commerce leaders say they\u2019re \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/searchnode.com\/blog\/ecommerce-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">very satisfied<\/a>\u201d with their site\u2019s search functionality. And it\u2019s unsurprising that 68% are planning to improve their site search in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing smart site search is one of the best things you can do to make your customers\u2019 lives easier. Again, ASOS does this well\u2014you only need to type a few characters in the search box to be offered all the most relevant options, plus information about how many products are available within that category.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"764\" height=\"170\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117987\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4.png 764w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-300x67.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-380x85.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-600x134.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-760x169.png 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-157x35.png 157w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-225x50.png 225w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-740x165.png 740w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-220x49.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-4-385x86.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e9ff85a7a3a4\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\"><\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 12 CRO resources to help you drive more leads and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for satisfaction guarantee examples or product page examples, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 23+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is rocket science.

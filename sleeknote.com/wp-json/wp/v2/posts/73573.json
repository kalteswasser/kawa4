It\u2019s easily implemented, and once you\u2019ve done so, all tasks within your department will be aligned with the goals of your department so no one wastes time doing irrelevant or low-priority work.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s break it down:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we have the <em>objective<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective is what you want to achieve. It\u2019s the overall goal that all your efforts should aim to accomplish.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This objective doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be measurable (I know you love measuring things, but bear with me).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sleeknote, we\u2019ve taken the approach of having objectives that are ambitious but can\u2019t be measured, meaning we will always try to reach these objectives, no matter how successful we become.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"288\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Red-Panda.gif\" alt=\"Red Panda\" class=\"wp-image-73594\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. One of our content marketing objectives is:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To position Sleeknote as <\/em>the<em> market authority in e-commerce conversion rate optimization, email marketing, and lead generation<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an unmeasurable objective doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to measure the effectiveness of your efforts\u2014this is where the <em>key results<\/em> come into play.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key results are (as the name implies) the specific results you want to achieve before the end of your timeframe.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These have to be measurable, specific and timed.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key results we\u2019ve decided is:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Achieve an average on-page conversion rate of 5%<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means we have a specific goal to chase, and we can easily measure whether or not this key result is achieved.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, your key results won\u2019t be achieved without <em>actions<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These actions refer to <em>how<\/em> you will reach your goals. Typically, you\u2019ll have many different actions to achieve one key result.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sleeknote, one of our actions to reach an on-page conversion rate of 5% is: <em>Create new landing pages for our website using the mind map overview<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, we now have a complete overview of the objective, the key result, and the actions that will help you achieve the key result.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s have a closer look at how you implement OKR in your department.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Implement OKR<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OKR is easily implemented in five simple steps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Define objectives<\/li><li>Define key results<\/li><li>Define actions<\/li><li>Define timeframe&nbsp;<\/li><li>Define who\u2019s responsible.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at each step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Define Objectives&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining your objective is the most important step.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the goal you\u2019ll be pursuing, and it needs to be ambitious and motivating.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have more than one objective for your department, depending on how large your team is, but I recommend committing to <strong>1-3 objectives for each team<\/strong>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more objectives you add, the more overwhelming it will seem, and the harder your employees will stay motivated.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image1.gif\" alt=\"It Is Too Much Gif\" class=\"wp-image-73610\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of marketing objectives for inspiration:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Define and <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-email-segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">understand our audience<\/a><\/li><li>Inform our audience of our product\u2019s best and newest features (and how it benefits them)<\/li><li>Grow our customer base, month over month (MoM)<\/li><li>Experiment with new marketing channels<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve defined 1-3 objectives for each team, you move on to the definition of your key results.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Define Key Results<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where we get more specific. Your key results must support your objective.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about ways to achieve your objective. What results are you looking to achieve in order to get closer to your objective?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, I\u2019d stick to around <strong>1-3 key results<\/strong> for each objective to avoid confusion.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your key results must be measurable, so you know exactly how close you are to achieving them\u2014and they have to be <em>ambitious<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201csweet spot\u201d for accomplishing key results should be around 70-75%. This means if you achieve your key results 100%, you haven\u2019t been ambitious enough, and you need to aim higher.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of key results:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Conduct ten online client surveys and analyze the results<\/li><li>Run five email marketing experiments to increase conversion rates<\/li><li>Run 10 experiments to increase traffic to the website<\/li><li>Map and analyze our current marketing channels and give at least eight recommendations to improve them.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Define Actions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re anything like me, you <em>love<\/em><strong> <\/strong>to-do lists.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing beats checking off item after item, keeping track of exactly how far along you are with your tasks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining your actions is just like creating a to-do list. It\u2019s the specific tasks you\u2019ll be working on to achieve your key results\u2014and more specifically <em>how<\/em> you\u2019ll achieve them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s return to one of our key results at Sleeknote: <em>achieve an average on-page conversion rate of 5%<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the actions we\u2019ve settled on to help us reach a 5% conversion rate:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Launch new website with an emphasis on product features, blog categories, and case studies<\/li><li>Publish three original, high-quality blog posts per week<\/li><li>Create new landing pages for the website using the mind map overview<\/li><li>Identify \u201ccontent gaps\u201d using <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/li><li>Monitor new keywords and competitor keywords<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The list goes on\u2026<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining your actions based on your key results will help you cut unnecessary actions that don\u2019t aid your key results and objectives.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Define Time Frame<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your objectives, key results, and actions must have a time frame.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the deadline for your OKR? Think of it as a sprint. An OKR typically runs every three months, however, sometimes it\u2019s necessary to adjust your time frame depending on the extent of your goals.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, at Sleeknote, we\u2019ve decided to create an OKR that runs from August 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2017 because we have a lot of actions that take time to develop and implement before we can see data with statistical significance.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t let your OKR run for too long, though. During your time frame, it\u2019s important to bear in mind your objectives and key results can\u2019t be changed.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your actions, on the other hand, can be changed as often as you like.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to achieve the objectives and key results, and through experiments and actions, we might discover things that work and things that don\u2019t. Once we\u2019ve identified what works and what doesn\u2019t, we adjust our efforts accordingly.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you might find that your <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/facebook-lead-ads\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook lead ads<\/a> aren\u2019t converting as much as you thought, and you need to either increase your ad spending or experiment with other channels to reach your key results.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Define Who\u2019s Responsible<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, you need to define who\u2019s responsible for what. At Sleeknote we\u2019ve divided our marketing department into two teams: a content team and a growth team.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an OKR example from our content team at Sleeknote:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"294\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeknote Content Team OKR\" class=\"wp-image-73606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-300x147.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-380x186.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-71x35.jpg 71w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-102x50.jpg 102w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-220x108.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Content-Team-OKR-385x189.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the team listed to the left, followed by the objectives, key results, and actions on the right.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we quickly found that this wasn\u2019t enough, and we needed to know exactly who was responsible for each work area and task.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the \u201cBatman &amp; Robin\u201d method comes in.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Batman &amp; Robin: How to Ensure Team Responsibility<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Batman &amp; Robin principle is simple:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Batman slays the bad guys, and Robin is there to assist him whenever he gets in too deep.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about how this applies to your marketing department. Every task needs to have a Batman (one who\u2019s responsible for carrying out the task) and a Robin (one who will assist Batman whenever he needs help or is away).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s have a look at the four reasons why you should implement the Batman &amp; Robin method.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Ensures everyone in your department knows exactly who\u2019s responsible for what<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common obstacle within departments is confusion over who\u2019s responsible for which tasks. When a task isn\u2019t completed, it can end in people pointing fingers at each other because no one knew they were responsible for that task.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"250\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Responsibility.gif\" alt=\"Responsibility\" class=\"wp-image-73598\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. You can easily see if someone has too much to do, or if they should be assigned more tasks<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t be Batman on everything. And you can\u2019t be Robin on everything. There needs to be a balance between your Batman &amp; Robin tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. There\u2019s always a backup if someone\u2019s away<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens if someone calls in sick or is away on vacation? Who\u2019s responsible for that person\u2019s tasks? Robin, of course.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use the Batman &amp; Robin structure, there\u2019s no confusion over who will take over when someone\u2019s away.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Things get done!<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s right. Owning responsibility for a task is easier when you understand exactly how it helps achieve an overall goal. Knowing that your work matters\u2014no matter how trivial it may seem\u2014makes you more motivated to get it done.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing exactly who\u2019s responsible for what, saves you time, and gets the job done faster.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an excerpt of our Batman &amp; Robin structure here at Sleeknote:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeknote Batman _ Robin\" class=\"wp-image-73602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-300x149.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-380x189.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-70x35.jpg 70w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-101x50.jpg 101w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-220x109.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sleeknote-Batman-_-Robin-385x191.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to implement Batman &amp; Robin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve implemented your OKR, the Batman &amp; Robin method is easily implemented in five simple steps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Define all tasks in your department<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have every member of your team define all their weekly or monthly recurring tasks. Skip small tasks that aren\u2019t recurring or top priority\u2014otherwise, you\u2019ll end up with a massive and overwhelming list.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, as we all know, things change quickly in marketing, so if you haven\u2019t done it already, you should implement <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/agile-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">agile marketing<\/a>, and have all your smaller tasks defined somewhere else for your own overview.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Assign the Batman<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once all recurring tasks have been defined and outlined, you need to assign a Batman for each task.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the Batman is responsible for carrying out this task, and also responsible for achieving any goals or results related to this task.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to keep a balance in how many tasks one person is Batman on, and distribute responsibility evenly throughout your team.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Assign the Robin<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Robin is the number two on each task. He or she has full responsibility for the task when Batman is away.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s Batman\u2019s responsibility to let Robin know when he or she is away and let Robin know what needs to be done.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, Robin should always stay updated on Batman\u2019s tasks so she can take over without spending too much time on getting up to speed.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robin is also the first one Batman will reach out to if he needs any help with the task. That way, everyone knows who to contact when they need help, and only the relevant people will be involved.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Oprah.gif\" alt=\"Oprah\" class=\"wp-image-73590\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Set a goal for each task<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sleeknote, we\u2019ve added small goals for each of the Batman &amp; Robin tasks. That way everyone knows why you do what you do.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, I\u2019m Batman on our email marketing in Intercom, and my goal is to s<em>et up new Intercom flow and run five experiments to increase free trial to customer conversion rate<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isabella is Robin on this task, and with the goal, it\u2019s easy for her to see what the purpose of our Intercom email marketing is for this specific OKR time frame whenever she might have to take over or help me out.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goals should always be defined in collaboration with the Batman, and they should also be measurable, so you can see if the goal has been reached by the end of the sprint.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting goals also motivate people to work harder and be more creative.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Print your Batman &amp; Robin structure on a massive poster and put it on a wall in your department<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting the poster on a wall makes it much easier for everyone to see, and quickly look at to see who to contact about a certain task.<br><\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e6f42148dc97\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\">FREE DOWNLOADABLE BONUS<\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Growth Marketing Strategies?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>Get access to our free growth marketing toolkit and skyrocket your website traffic today (includes resources not found in the blog post).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Growth Marketing Toolkit \u2192\">Download Growth Marketing Toolkit \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Growth Marketing Strategies?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Work Smarter, Not Harder<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since implementing OKR and the Batman &amp; Robin principle, we\u2019ve increased our department&#8217;s effectiveness.

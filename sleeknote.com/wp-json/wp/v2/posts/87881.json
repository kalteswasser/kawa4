And while there\u2019s nothing wrong with using discounts as an incentive, you should be careful with it.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make a habit of offering discounts to abandoning shoppers, this can potentially result in people abandoning their carts on purpose because they expect a discount.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you should focus on the items in the cart and add scarcity to the incentive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/kcallife.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">KCAL<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f71e4743ad40\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/KCAL-Exit-Intent.jpg\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

Competitions and Giveaways<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout history, people have loved competitions in one form or another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A competition is described by psychologists as an \u201c<a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/socially-relevant\/201506\/the-psychology-competition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extrinsic incentive.<\/a>\u201d This means that the motivation to adopt a behavior or decision comes from the prospect of getting a reward.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the ancient Greek Olympic Games to modern soccer. Competition is one of the greatest motivational factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why not try to use competitions as your CTA to collect leads for your email list?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of marketers are already using competitions as an incentive to build their email list and with great success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.jyskvin.dk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jysk Vin<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f71e4ea3ad42\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Jysk-Vin-Competition-1.jpg\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

This increases the trustworthiness of your competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t ever write <em>sign up<\/em> in your CTA button. I\u2019ve said this many times before, and I\u2019ll keep saying it until every <em>sign up<\/em> has been erased from the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few alternatives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Yes &#8211; I\u2019m In<\/li><li>I\u2019d Love to Win a [product name]<\/li><li>Your Chance to Win Starts Here<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But be careful when you use competitions and giveaways as an incentive. It will definitely increase conversion rates, but it might also lower the quality of the leads you get. It\u2019s a balance, and only you can tell if this CTA will work for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-light-grey-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Takeaway<\/strong>: Make sure your competition is relevant to your product to increase the quality of your leads. It\u2019s also a good idea to follow up by email with everyone who entered the competition to let them know the competition has ended and who won. (You can even include a CTA to buy the product at a special price for those who didn\u2019t win).<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>iii. Newsletter Value<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Content upgrades, competitions, discounts\u2014all good incentives to increase conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you just want to promote your newsletter as it is?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No worries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to use your newsletter as the only incentive, you just need to answer one question:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do people get when they join your newsletter?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one signs up for a newsletter. They sign up to get <strong>value<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So focus on that value when you write your CTA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gq-magazine.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">GQ Magazine<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f71e56d3ad44\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/GQ-Magazine-Newsletter-Value.jpg\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

Product Guides<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many e-commerce stores have a large range of products. But the problem with purchasing online is that prospects can\u2019t try on the products as they can in a physical store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge obstacle for many online shoppers so you should try to eliminate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do so by offering guides for specific product categories that will help prospects make the right decision, and give them the feeling of being in a store trying on the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to do this is to offer size guides on specific product pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a recent example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chubbiesshorts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Chubbies<\/a>:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"571\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-1024x571.gif\" alt=\"Chubbies-Size-Guide\" class=\"wp-image-87910\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-1024x571.gif 1024w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-300x167.gif 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-768x428.gif 768w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-380x212.gif 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-600x335.gif 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-760x424.gif 760w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-63x35.gif 63w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-90x50.gif 90w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-740x413.gif 740w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-220x123.gif 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Chubbies-Size-Guide-2-385x215.gif 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just below the sizes, there\u2019s a link triggering a campaign with a size guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CTA is simple:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Size Guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make your CTA more \u201cclickable\u201d, you should try using questions as an attention drawer (see examples later on).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By having the size guide appear as a campaign on the product page makes it easier for prospects to return to the product once they\u2019ve found the right size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you avoid prospects dropping off because they can\u2019t find their way back to the product from a different landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to increase conversions on your product pages is to create a CTA that says: <em>Add to cart<\/em> in the actual product guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you\u2019ve eliminated a step in the customer journey, which can increase your overall visitor to customer conversion rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few CTA examples for product guides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(Clothing and shoes): Not sure which size to choose?

People might not always know where they want to go for their next vacation, but a quiz is a fun way to find out\u2014and it will get prospects closer to buying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of what that could look like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f71e5d33ad45\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Quiz-Campaign-Template-1.jpg\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

What is the outcome of the quiz? What will visitors learn from it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples to try:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Find out What [blank] You Are<\/li><li>Find Your Perfect [your product here] Now<\/li><li>Discover Your New [your product here] Now<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of your quiz should always include a product recommendation.

Just make sure prospects know what to do (in this case, fill in the information), and then create a CTA button that emphasizes what they\u2019re getting when they click.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of CTA\u2019s you can use:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a Quote for Your Dream Trip Now<\/li><li>Click Here for Your Custom Quote<\/li><li>Send Me My Custom Quote<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re selling travels or tailored outfits for dogs, offering a custom quote will not only bring prospects closer to buying from you, it will also strengthen your relationship with them because you\u2019re offering a personal shopping experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important that you contact these leads quickly. (Preferably within an hour.)\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you contact potential buyers within an hour of hearing from them, you\u2019re <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2011\/03\/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seven times more likely<\/a> to qualify that customer than you are an hour later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-shadow-box has-sleek-light-grey-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Takeaway<\/strong>: Use campaigns offering custom quotes if you sell products with a longer purchase cycle. Make sure to get in touch with these leads asap to increase the likelihood of them making a purchase.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>ii. Book Consultations<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, we need expert advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s choosing the right curtains for your living room. Finding the right food for your dog. Or putting together the perfect outfit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers want the best of the best, and that means getting the right people to help them choose the best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s where you come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re the expert in your industry, and you can help prospects make the right decision when it comes to choosing the best products for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to invite potential buyers to take advantage of your expertise is to use a campaign on your site offering a consultation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"campaign-template-block_5f71e6b13ad48\" class=\"block-campaign-template\">\n    <div class=\"template-placeholder\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Book-a-Meeting-SleekBox-1.jpg\" title=\"Create a similar campaign\">        <p class=\"image-caption\">Create a similar campaign<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"cta-block\">\n        <div class=\"tag\">NEW<\/div>\n        <div class=\"cta-block-content\">\n            <p>Like what you see?

Booking appointments will usually require you getting a lot of information from prospects, but try to limit the number of input fields. And make sure your CTA button confirms the action in your campaign.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>iii.

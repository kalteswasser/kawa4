Customer Acquisition Cost<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no such thing as an e-commerce business with too many customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than two billion people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/623566\/web-visits-to-amazoncom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit Amazon.com every month<\/a>, but I can assure you Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t lie awake at night worrying about all that traffic\u2014he wants more and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, customer growth is only good if it\u2019s sustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/average-order-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">average order value<\/a> is \u20ac50 but it costs you \u20ac75 to acquire a new customer, every one of those new customers is losing you money. That\u2019s why customer acquisition cost (CAC) is such an important KPI.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAC is simple to calculate. Take your total sales and marketing costs, then divide that figure by the number of new customers you won in a given period (say, a month).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I spent \u20ac10,000 on sales and marketing in March and brought in 1,000 new customers, my CAC was \u20ac10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that good? Depends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAC on its own tells you nothing. It only gains meaning when balanced against other KPIs\u2014specifically, <em>average order value <\/em>and<em> <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/customer-lifetime-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>customer lifetime value<\/em><\/a>. I\u2019ll dig into them in the next two sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\"><strong>2. Average Order Value<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, your average order value (AOV) is how much each customer spends at the tills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To work it out, divide your total revenue by the number of orders you received. If I made \u20ac100,000 in revenue from 5,000 orders, my AOV is \u20ac20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On its own, that number doesn\u2019t tell me much. However, I already know my CAC is \u20ac10, so if my AOV is double that figure, there\u2019s a decent chance I\u2019m running a sustainable business. (I can\u2019t be certain, though\u2014for that, I\u2019d need to know my customer lifetime value too.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tracking your AOV over time, you can accurately measure your attempts to increase it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why\u2019s that so important?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because acquiring customers is expensive. According to one widely quoted stat, it costs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/customer-acquisition-retention\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">five times more<\/a> to attract a new customer than to retain an existing one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/upselling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drive up your average order value<\/a> by just a few euros, you\u2019ll make a lot more money, without having to spend any more on acquisition. It\u2019s pretty much the most efficient way to grow an e-commerce business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Customer Lifetime Value<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next piece in the \u201cam I running a sustainable business?\u201d puzzle is the customer lifetime value (CLV).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, CLV is the average net profit you make from each customer throughout their relationship with your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate CLV, you need to multiply three other metrics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Your average order value;<\/li><li>How many times the average customer buys from you per year; and<\/li><li>The average length of their relationship with you in years.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve already worked out my AOV is \u20ac20. So if my average customer buys three times a year and sticks with me for five years, my CLV is \u20ac300.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we\u2019re starting to get some real meaning from these numbers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, your CLV to CAC ratio should be at or above 3:1. I\u2019m only paying \u20ac10 to acquire each customer, but I\u2019m making \u20ac300 from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these numbers, it looks like I\u2019ve laid the foundations for a sustainable, high-growth e-commerce business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. Conversion Rate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve done a ton of work to <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/increase-e-commerce-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drive traffic to your site<\/a>. You\u2019ve invested in <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO<\/a>, built social ads, and run paid search campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that time and money count for nothing if those visitors bounce straight back off the moment they land on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversion rate<\/a>\u2014the percentage of users who perform an action on your site\u2014is another important KPI. It\u2019ll tell you whether your key <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-landing-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">landing pages<\/a> are working as intended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need to track a range of conversion rates, because you likely have more than one \u201caction\u201d you want visitors to perform. Those actions could include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/list-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Opting in<\/a> for your newsletter;<\/li><li>Downloading a piece of content;<\/li><li>Signing up for your <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/customer-loyalty-programs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">loyalty program<\/a>;<\/li><li>Adding a product to cart;<\/li><li>Buying a product.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversion rates will vary widely depending on the type of action you\u2019re tracking. For example, looking specifically at purchases, the average global e-commerce conversion rate stood at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/439576\/online-shopper-conversion-rate-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2.58 percent<\/a> in Q2 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A newsletter signup page might have a conversion rate of 20 percent because it\u2019s a free, low-commitment transaction. On the other hand, I suspect the landing page for the \u20ac87,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/en_GB\/models\/design?redirect=no#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tesla Model S<\/a> converts at a slightly lower rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. Shopping Cart Abandonment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While conversion rate measures the proportion of people who <em>complete <\/em>the desired action, <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/cart-abandonment-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shopping cart abandonment<\/a> does the opposite. It charts the percentage of users who fail to complete the action of making a purchase from your e-commerce site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate your abandonment rate, divide your number of completed purchases by the number of shopping carts opened, subtract the result from one, and then express it as a percentage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I have 4,000 completed transactions from 10,000 shopping carts created, that\u2019s an abandonment rate of 60 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That number sounds astonishingly high, but it\u2019s actually way better than most. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/baymard.com\/lists\/cart-abandonment-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Baymard Institute<\/a>, the average shopping cart abandonment rate stands at almost 70 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are all those merciless online shoppers adding-to-bag then failing to buy? Baymard Institute gives us lots<em> <\/em>of reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-118795\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-292x300.png 292w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-380x390.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-34x35.png 34w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-49x50.png 49w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-477x490.png 477w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-220x226.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-16-385x395.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One final point from the above study: the average large e-commerce site could see a 35.26 percent upturn in conversion rate by designing a <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/checkout-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">better checkout.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the combined value of all e-commerce sales in the EU and US, that equates to an eye-watering $260 billion in lost orders that could be recovered through improved checkout design and flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6. Ad Impressions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/organic-reach-declining\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">organic reach in decline<\/a>, e-commerce brands are increasingly finding that social media and search marketing are becoming pay-to-play environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re running paid activity, whether paid search or social ads, you need to have KPIs in place around your campaigns. Otherwise, how can you tell if it\u2019s working?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of metrics you could be tracked here, but one of the most important is ad impressions\u2014the number of times your ad is fetched from its source and displayed. That could happen on a social platform, on a search engine results page, in an app, or on a third-party site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find information on impressions within your advertising platform of choice, whether that\u2019s Google, <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-facebook-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook<\/a>, Instagram, or something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressions and clicks are not the same. Just because your ad was presented to someone, that doesn\u2019t mean they interacted with it. So why are they such a big deal?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, there are two main reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Impressions are arguably the most controllable metric.<\/strong> If your impressions are dropping, that\u2019s likely a sign you need to increase your budget and\/or bid.<\/li><li><strong>Impressions control everything else. <\/strong>It doesn\u2019t matter how compelling your ads are\u2014if you\u2019re not generating impressions, no one\u2019s going to see them.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7. Return On Ad Spend<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another ad-specific metric, return on ad spend (ROAS) is pretty much what it sounds like\u2014the amount of revenue you\u2019re generating from your ad investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I spend \u20ac10,000 on advertising for a return of \u20ac100,000, my ROAS is 10. Simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After impressions, it\u2019s my second favorite ad metric (what do you mean you don\u2019t have favorite ad metrics?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because it\u2019s tied to your bottom line. Sure, cost per click, click-through rate, and conversion rate are all important too. But the only thing that really<em> <\/em>matters is whether your ads are making enough money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with CLV to CAC, the 3:1 ratio is a good guide to whether your return on ad spend is high enough. So if I\u2019m spending \u20ac10,000 but only returning \u20ac20,000, my ad activity likely isn\u2019t sustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8\"><strong>8. Email Open Rate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like impressions, this one isn\u2019t specifically related to e-commerce. But <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/best-email-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email marketing<\/a> is so essential to online retailers that I had to include it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/company\/annual-report\/2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Campaign Monitor<\/a> figures, email generates an average return of $42 for every $1 invested. That\u2019s way more than most brands will see from any other channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to measuring <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/increase-email-open-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open rates<\/a>, your chosen <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/best-email-marketing-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email marketing platform<\/a> will do all the calculations for you. If you\u2019re seeing rates of 15-25 percent, you\u2019re doing okay (the higher, the better).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>9. Gross Profit Margin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last three metrics have all been campaign and channel-specific, so for my final entry, I\u2019m going to zoom back out and look at a big, overarching metric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gross profit margin shows you the difference between the <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/how-to-price-a-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revenue<\/a> you generate and the profit you earn off the back of it. To calculate it, you need to know two things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Total revenue: <\/strong>The number of units sold multiplied by the price.<\/li><li><strong>Cost of goods sold (COGS): <\/strong>Your total business costs, accounting for things like manufacturing, marketing, salaries, and operations.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>First, subtract COGS from total revenue. That\u2019ll leave you with your gross profit. Then divide that figure by total revenue to calculate your gross profit margin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if my total revenue last month was \u20ac100,000 and my COGS was \u20ac70,000, I made a gross profit of \u20ac30,000 at a margin of 0.3, or 30 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high gross profit margin is, obviously, a good thing. It leaves you with plenty of cash to invest back into the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, if your margin is low, growth will be stunted, and you\u2019ll likely run into cash flow problems.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e9ff85a7a3a4\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\"><\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 12 CRO resources to help you drive more leads and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for satisfaction guarantee examples or product page examples, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 23+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, most people don\u2019t start an e-commerce business because they love<em> <\/em>tracking KPIs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they\u2019ll always have some sort of goal in mind.

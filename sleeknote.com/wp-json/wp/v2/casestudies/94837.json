We quickly saw how effective Sleeknote was, so we kept on using it. Since then we\u2019ve also discovered all the other opportunities Sleeknote offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason why we chose Sleeknote is that it\u2019s very user-friendly compared to other lead generation tools. Everyone can create a sleeknote \u2013 Let me give you an example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier today, I asked one of our interns to create a SleekBox on a landing page for Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven, where a SleekBox should pop up and offer a discount code to customers coming from a specific page. It was the first time she used Sleeknote, and she created the SleekBox without any problems. I\u2019m not lying when I tell you that she was shocked at how easy it was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Do You Use Sleeknote for Today?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Exit-intent SleekBox<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever we are doing marketing, we try to include Sleeknote in some way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we make Sleeknote campaigns with<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/features\/exit-intent\" target=\"_blank\"> the exit-intent trigger<\/a> that shows whenever our customers are about to leave our site. Then a popup shows up offering a 5% discount code. Actually, we called the discount code SN5 (Sleeknote 5). That discount code gained a lot of revenue from customers about to leave the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Collecting Leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, we also use Sleeknote to grow our email list. It has helped us harvest a lot of emails and has performed very well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also use Sleeknote on our landing pages, when we do AdWords. Instead of putting discount codes all over the landing page, we use Sleeknote to put some conditions on it. for example, If we have an Ad for \u201cCheap prams\u201d, we isolate a few prams on the landing page and combine it with a time activated SleekBox that offers a discount code after a short time. This method has generated a lot of sales!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a SleekBox on Pixizoo\u2019s website:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"344\" height=\"439\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1.png\" alt=\"pixizoo-sleekbox1\" class=\"wp-image-94846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1.png 344w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1-235x300.png 235w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1-27x35.png 27w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1-39x50.png 39w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1-220x281.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Service Announcement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I would like to mention how we have used Sleeknote to deliver service messages. If our phones at customer service don\u2019t work, we can easily put a service announcement on our website saying \u201cOur phones are temporarily down, please wait 30 min. before calling us\u201d. It is easy to implement because we always have a SleekBox with an announcement ready to activate, and the SleekBox is very easy to adjust. The service message creates a much better understanding of our customers than if we didn\u2019t have anything on our site. I think Sleeknote works quite excellent and is very user-friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"testimonial-block_5ec2660d6f3ab\" class=\"block-testimonial\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n        \u201cSleeknote is insanely easy to use. It\u2019s just about having the idea of how to use it and some traffic on your website \u2013 Then you\u2019re ready to utilize Sleeknote.&#8221;    <\/blockquote>\n    <div class=\"customer\">\n        <div class=\"customer-image\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/nicolai-meldgaard-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"nicolai-meldgaard\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/nicolai-meldgaard-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/nicolai-meldgaard-120x120.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/> <\/div>        <div class=\"customer-meta\" style=\"\">\n            <span class=\"customer-name\">Nicolai Meldgaard<\/span>\n            <span class=\"customer-title\">eCommerce and SoMe manager, Pixizoo<\/span>        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely the time management function! I actually remember that we wrote to you suggesting this feature, and you created it shortly after. It is great to see that you take feedback seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often use this function when we run campaigns. For example, if we run a campaign offering a 10% discount on the entire webshop from 6-12 pm, I don\u2019t have to activate the SleekBox at 6 pm and turn it off at 12 pm. That\u2019s smart!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also a major advantage that we can manage the SleekBox by sources and UTM codes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of signups for our newsletter has exploded since we started using Sleeknote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cart abandonment SleekBox has also performed great and has really helped us to make sales to customers who otherwise would have left the cart. We can\u2019t measure the exact conversion rate since we\u2019re using a discount code and not a CTA button on that sleeknote, but we\u2019ve compared how many views the site has with the number of times the discount code has been used \u2013 And the result showed exactly why Sleeknote is worth the money we spend on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Would You Recommend, If I Were to Try Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were to try Sleeknote as a new customer, I would follow these steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Think about what the purpose of your SleekBoxes is \u2013 What should your SleekBoxes do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Go to Google Analytics and find out where on your website your SleekBoxes should be placed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Book a Best Practice meeting with the Sleeknote team \u2013 It\u2019s 15 minutes well spent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Start building your SleekBox in the drag-n-drop editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleeknote is insanely easy to use. It\u2019s just about having the idea of how to use it and some traffic on your website \u2013 Then you\u2019re ready to utilize Sleeknote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It couldn\u2019t be better. I\u2019ve written to you a few times, and every time you\u2019ve responded quickly and with all the information I needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d also like to mention, that I follow a few forums about ecommerce, and you\u2019re very good at answering questions on these forums and to be objective at the same time. You\u2019re not just telling people to choose Sleeknote, but instead, you say \u201cfeel free to choose the competitor, but we can do this\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, your team seems awesome and that\u2019s also what I\u2019ve heard other marketers say about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-plum-color has-text-color\">PIXIZOO&nbsp; SLEEKBOXES<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"slideshow-block_5ec266436f3ac\" class=\"block-slideshow\">\n\n\n\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery\">\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/pixizoo-sleekbox1.png\" alt=\"pixizoo-sleekbox1\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n        <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls\">\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-no\">\n                <span class=\"gallery-index-current\"><\/span> of <span class=\"gallery-index-total\"><\/span>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-btns\">\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-prev\" role=\"navigation\">Previous<\/button><span><\/span><button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-next\" role=\"navigation\">Next<\/button>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    \n\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n","protected":false},"featured_media":94838,"parent":0,"template":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Pixizoo Engage Visitors Using Page-Specific SleekBoxes<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Considering Sleeknote?

Three years ago, they started expanding into the mid-range price segment through a new outlet, Booztlet.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over these three years, Booztlet\u2019s massive growth has taken the company by storm. In fact, their current predictions place Booztlet as a growth driver for the entire company, over the next three-to-five years. This makes maintaining and accelerating growth a top priority for Kim Vile, Boozt\u2019s E-Commerce Director.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Growing Pains<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a new company, establishing a fast pace of growth is natural, but maintaining it throughout the years is the real challenge. The common view of growth identifies two key processes: acquiring new customers and retaining old ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Booztlet tackles the mid-range price segment, so a big part of their sales revolve around special offers, discounts, and deals. At first, they ran weekly campaigns on their site, including special deals and discounts that all of their visitors had access to. While they had a positive impact on sales, these campaigns did little in terms of customer retention. To use them to their full potential, Kim Vile turned them into incentives for signing up to the company\u2019s newsletter, by making them exclusive to subscribers. In doing so, he created a \u201clow-key loyalty membership.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Booztlet Chose Sleeknote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Booztlet uses their newsletter to create desire and interest through new collections and special deals sent to subscribers, as well as improving their on-site experience through direct access to their weekly campaigns. As of writing, it accounts for half of the company\u2019s sales, making it a crucial part of their marketing strategy. The strategy for the newsletter is even more ambitious in the long run, aiming to introduce more personalized campaigns and on-site interactions for subscribers down the line. In either case, it plays\u2014and will continue to play\u2014a major role in Booztlet\u2019s marketing strategy in the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to increase newsletter signups, Kim looked for ways to engage visitors on-site and make opting in simple. \u201cI\u2019m using Sleeknote for its rules,\u201d Kim told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just so easy to set when, where and how often to show your campaigns. Without any technical knowledge, you can set up a campaign within five minutes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Booztlet Used Sleeknote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Booztlet turned their weekly campaigns into incentives for signing up to their newsletter, by making the best deals and discounts exclusive to subscribers. They did this in two ways: by sending them newsletters about the latest offers, as well as using cookies on-site to differentiate between new visitors and subscribers. In doing so, subscribers were given access to the discounts immediately, while new visitors were shown the SleekBox below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png\" alt=\"Booztlet-SleekBox-1\" class=\"wp-image-95483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png 624w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-380x178.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-600x281.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-75x35.png 75w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-107x50.png 107w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-220x103.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-385x180.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This simple concept proved to be extremely effective, generating leads for Booztlet\u2019s newsletter on their international site, as well as their specific Danish, Finnish and Swedish sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, they used Sleeknote\u2019s cookie tracking capabilities to show on-site messages and offers only to their newsletter subscribers.

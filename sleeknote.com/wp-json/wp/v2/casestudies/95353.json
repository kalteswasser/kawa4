As a growing market, it presents many opportunities for car manufacturers to sell more than ever before, provided they find a way to stand out from the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Backer, Toyota Denmark\u2019s Digital Marketing Manager, chose to focus on improving their website\u2019s conversions. For them, the three ways to do this were by booking test drives, getting trade-in leads for used cars and converting visitors to newsletter subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Booking Test Drives<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Test drives are one of the most important conversions Toyota can achieve through their website, as Alex explained it: \u201cTest drives are the closest we can get to a success. We know that out of the people who test our cars, about half end up buying them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To convince visitors to book a test drive, Alex made it simple and relevant by creating a \u201cBook a Test Drive\u201d campaign, specific to different cars on their site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"296\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1.png\" alt=\"ToyotaSleekBox1\" class=\"wp-image-95362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1.png 296w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1-282x300.png 282w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1-33x35.png 33w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1-47x50.png 47w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox1-220x234.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these campaigns, Toyota Denmark increased their test drive bookings by 27%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting Trade-In Leads<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way Toyota increased sales was through trade-in leads since many of the people who sold their car to Toyota made a new purchase from them. \u201cAbout 17% of the trade-in leads turn into sales,\u201d Alex told me. \u201cThese generate two-thirds of our conversions and are some of the best leads we get!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Sleeknote, they created a \u201cGet a Quote\u201d form for visitors who were likely interested. Making the form page-specific ensured that it wouldn\u2019t appear for visitors who were only browsing Toyota\u2019s car lineup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"357\" height=\"369\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1.png\" alt=\"ToyotaSleekBox2-1\" class=\"wp-image-95366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1.png 357w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-290x300.png 290w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-34x35.png 34w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-48x50.png 48w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox2-1-220x227.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For Toyota Denmark, the concept of \u201ctrade-in leads\u201d was created through this campaign. Previously, visitors would go to the dealerships and ask for a quote on their used cars, which required effort and time. The added convenience of filling in the form directly on Toyota\u2019s website made the process easier for the visitors, while generating valuable leads for the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Generating Leads Under the GDPR<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aware that the EU General Data Protection Regulation (<a href=\"https:\/\/eugdpr.org\/the-regulation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GDPR<\/a>) changed policies regarding data and privacy, Toyota decided to implement a double opt-in process for their email newsletter. The added step required to complete a signup left Alex facing a new issue: \u201cWe needed a place on our website where we could motivate visitors to give us their permission.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their solution was creating a \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d landing page, where visitors would have to complete the double opt-in to spin it. Alex then used a SleekBox to guide website visitors to that page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"558\" height=\"298\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3.png\" alt=\"ToyotaSleekBox3\" class=\"wp-image-95370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3.png 558w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-300x160.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-380x203.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-66x35.png 66w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-94x50.png 94w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-220x117.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ToyotaSleekBox3-385x206.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This SleekBox converted at 40.3%. 95% of the newsletter signups gained completed the double opt-in process.

Once active on the website, it allowed Toyota to add campaigns to any of their pages without additional code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was especially important for Alex, as he didn\u2019t have direct access to their CMS system. \u201cAny change I want to make needs to go through our main office. And that\u2019s a really slow process,\u201d he explained. \u201cI have used other systems and ran into the same issues. I always needed to integrate the embedded code into the website code on every specific page, so I had to get a developer to put in the code. With Sleeknote I can simply pick and choose the pages I want to have it on.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<h2>Want Similar Results?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Sleeknote, Toyota Denmark have boosted their on-page conversion rate by 130%, while increasing their test drive bookings by 27%.

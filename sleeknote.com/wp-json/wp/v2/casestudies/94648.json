List Building<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our marketing efforts are primarily focused around our newsletter, Google AdWords, and SEO. We chose Sleeknote because we needed a tool to grow our email list in order to send our newsletter to a much larger group of people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought Sleeknote after I had talked to a fellow marketer, who recommended using popups to increase newsletter signups. We later had a visitor from a company that does customer surveys, who recommended Sleeknote, because he has very good experience with it. So I can honestly say that my decision to use Sleeknote, is based on recommendations from your existing customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"334\" height=\"496\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox.png\" alt=\"datamarked sleekbox\" class=\"wp-image-94657\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox.png 334w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox-202x300.png 202w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox-24x35.png 24w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox-34x50.png 34w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox-330x490.png 330w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/datamarked-sleekbox-220x327.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Guiding Visitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have used SleekBoxes with competitions, and we are now using them without any giveaways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, we also use SleekBoxes to ask our customers to air their opinion after a purchase at skilteproduktion.dk. The feedback we get is very useful, and that SleekBox actually has a good conversion rate as our visitors give a lot of responses.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"testimonial-block_5ec25870df12a\" class=\"block-testimonial\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n        \u201cWhat\u2019s way more interesting is that the open rate on our newsletter has increased considerably since we implemented Sleeknote.\u201d    <\/blockquote>\n    <div class=\"customer\">\n        <div class=\"customer-image\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Casper\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-35x35.jpg 35w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-220x220.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper-120x120.jpg 120w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Casper.jpg 331w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/> <\/div>        <div class=\"customer-meta\" style=\"\">\n            <span class=\"customer-name\">Casper Lengaard N\u00f8rrevang<\/span>\n            <span class=\"customer-title\">Sales and Marketing Assistant<\/span>        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Was the Implementation of Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You write on your website that it is extremely user-friendly, and that you don\u2019t need any graphic artist skills to use it \u2013 which is true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have used a graphic designer to do some pictures and images for us that we wanted on our SleekBoxes, but that is purely because we wanted the images to be of a high a quality as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the experience has been great, and very user-friendly, and I have had no problem using the software with my limited design and technical knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best feature is the dashboard. It is really important that you see the effect your SleekBox has. I love that you can see how many leads the SleekBox has generated, what the conversion rate is, and how many views it gets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashboard also gives a good overview and basis for new SleekBoxes. You can see what worked in previous SleekBoxes by looking at the conversion rates. Generally, the dashboard is nice and manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We get a lot more signups for our newsletter than we did before Sleeknote, which we also expected. What\u2019s way more interesting is that the open rate on our newsletter has increased considerably since we implemented Sleeknote. We can\u2019t measure if SleekBox affects this directly, but my assumption is that those who sign up via a SleekBox are relevant leads who would like to have our newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Describe Sleeknote with Three Words<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>User-friendly, manageable, and effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you should contact Sleeknote and tell them what kind of business you have. Let Sleeknote tell you how your business can benefit from popups and how to use Sleeknote the best way possible for your kind of business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation with Sleeknote gives you some ideas about how to use Sleeknote, so the next step would be to sign up for a free trial, and create your first SleekBox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The staff is friendly and helpful.

If it doesn\u2019t work it\u2019s because the design and message in your newsletter aren\u2019t good enough. Our experience is that email as a platform works very well, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get a large and relevant database of subscribers you can send your mail to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we get a new customer, we often implement Sleeknote as one of the first things in order to get more subscribers to their newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested a few other lead generation tools, but none of the other tools were as user friendly as Sleeknote. Even though some of your competitors have lower prices, we would lose money by using them because we would need to spend much more time on managing the popups, and that\u2019s why we chose Sleeknote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then you\u2019ve added a lot of features and delivered fantastic service, so we are very satisfied with our choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, we needed a tool to generate leads and signups for our newsletter. We were looking for a user-friendly tool that everyone at our office was able to manage. This is very important as everyone at our office needs to be able to change the popups right away if our customers ask us to do that \u2013 That\u2019s part of our service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested a few other lead generation tools, but none of the other tools were as user friendly as Sleeknote.

When they have signed up, they automatically enter an email flow that sends tips and tricks in a very personalized style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also had another SleekBox on WeMarket telling our customers to sign up and get a free written examination of their company. We actually had to disable that SleekBox because it generated more leads than we were able to handle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the leads we got weren\u2019t as good as those who call us directly, but it\u2019s a good way to get leads from those who just visit our website. We\u2019ve done A\/B split testing of our SleekBoxes, and we clearly see that social proof works brilliantly, and that is probably why the SleekBox performed so well.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"testimonial-block_5ec258e5b7224\" class=\"block-testimonial\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n        \u201cWhen we get a new customer, we often implement Sleeknote as one of the first things in order to get more subscribers to their newsletter. \u201d    <\/blockquote>\n    <div class=\"customer\">\n        <div class=\"customer-image\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Thomas-Haurum-1-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Thomas-Haurum-1\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Thomas-Haurum-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Thomas-Haurum-1-120x120.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/> <\/div>        <div class=\"customer-meta\" style=\"\">\n            <span class=\"customer-name\">Thomas Haurum<\/span>\n            <span class=\"customer-title\">Founder<\/span>        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Function or Option?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That you\u2019re able to customize your sleeknotes just the way you want it. We have a wide range of customers and it is a major advantage that we can create completely different sleeknotes. Ultimately, you have a sleeknote tailored to each site with a specific purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature I appreciate is the exclude\/include URL function. As an example, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense if the visitors from our facebook gets a popup saying \u201cFollow us on Facebook\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If we disable Sleeknote we get 2-5% fewer leads each day than we do with a SleekBox activated \u2013 And that\u2019s the same for our customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An interesting fact is that we end up with a sale to a lot of the leads who sign up via a SleekBox, so it gives a high number of qualified leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Describe Sleeknote with Your Own Words.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleeknote is very user friendly. It has a broad appeal, which means that it is a great tool for all businesses no matter the size or level of ambition. You simply adjust your sleeknotes to your specific needs and requirements. Even a small business with limited IT skills could easily implement Sleeknote, which they wouldn\u2019t be able to with a WordPress plugin for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing is to set up your sleeknote and give it a fair chance. Each day, around 97% of your visitors leave your site without leaving a trace. If you use Google AdWords for example, you have already paid for the click \u2013 so why not try to convert your visitors into leads? Sleeknote enhances the effect of your other marketing channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I contact you, I get the feeling that you are ready to help me. You have short response time and outstanding service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-plum-color has-text-color\">WEMARKET SLEEKBOXES<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"slideshow-block_5ec25906b7225\" class=\"block-slideshow\">\n\n\n\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery\">\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/wemarket2-1.png\" alt=\"wemarket2-1\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/wemarket.png\" alt=\"wemarket\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n        <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls\">\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-no\">\n                <span class=\"gallery-index-current\"><\/span> of <span class=\"gallery-index-total\"><\/span>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-btns\">\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-prev\" role=\"navigation\">Previous<\/button><span><\/span><button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-next\" role=\"navigation\">Next<\/button>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    \n\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n","protected":false},"featured_media":94666,"parent":0,"template":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How WeMarket Uses Sleeknote To Generate 5% More Leads Every Day<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Considering Sleeknote?

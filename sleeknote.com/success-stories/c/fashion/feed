<h2>Increasing Transactions with Managed Solution</h2>



<p>Back in March 2019, Kings &amp; Queens started working with Sleeknote Managed Solution and ViaBill (an installment plan payment option). The goal was to promote the option to pay with ViaBill and increase the number of ViaBill transactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sleeknote.com/managed-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sleeknote Managed Solution</a> is the newest in-house Sleeknote service, where conversion optimization experts manage your Sleeknote account with the purpose of generating more leads, boosting sales, and providing a better user experience on the customer’s site.</p>



<p>After three months, Kings &amp; Queens’ results speak for themselves:</p>



<ul><li>The number of ViaBill transactions has <strong>increased by 69.68% </strong>(subject to seasonal fluctuations)</li><li>The conversion rate for e-commerce on selected offers and campaigns has <strong>increased by 522.52%</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li>They’ve <strong>collected more than 8,000 newsletter subscribers.</strong></li></ul>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Promoting the New Payment Option</h2>



<p>To promote the option to pay with ViaBill, the Managed Solution team set up a campaign to create awareness around the alternative payment option.</p>



<p>The campaign promotes the advantages of choosing ViaBill as a payment option.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="308" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg" alt="Promoting the New Payment Option Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95529" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-300x243.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-43x35.jpg 43w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-62x50.jpg 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promoting-the-New-Payment-Option-Sleekbox-1-220x178.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Boosting Sales with Category-Specific Campaigns</h2>



<p>The Managed Solution team set up several different campaigns on the Kings &amp; Queens website to promote relevant offers (e.g. two t-shirts for 200 DKK).</p>



<p>With Sleeknote, it’s possible to trigger the campaigns on specific URLs and for specific site visitors.</p>



<p>“We’ve struggled with promoting the offers we’ve had on the site–especially the ones where you can buy two or three t-shirts and get a discount.” says e-commerce manager, Ronni Andersen. “But because Sleeknote is so flexible, we can have specific campaigns with our Tommy Hilfiger t-shirts on our Tommy Hilfiger category page.”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="372" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3.jpg" alt="Boosting Sales with Category-Specific Campaigns Sleekbox 3" class="wp-image-95517" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-300x186.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-380x236.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-56x35.jpg 56w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-81x50.jpg 81w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-220x136.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boosting-Sales-with-Category-Specific-Campaigns-Sleekbox-3-385x239.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>With a campaign promoting offers on relevant products, Kings &amp; Queens are able to give their visitors the feeling of being guided to better purchase decisions–just like they would in a physical store.</p>



<p>And these campaigns have paid off.</p>



<p>Their campaign promoting two t-shirts for DKK 200, has <strong>increased their conversion rate by 522%.</strong></p>



<p>That means 10% of visitors that clicked the campaign made a purchase. And out of the visitors who saw the campaign but didn’t click through, 1.61% converted into customers in the same period.</p>

<h2>A Flexible Tool for Mid-Season Sale</h2>



<p>From May 1st, 2019 to May 15th, 2019, Kings &amp; Queens had a mid-season sale. During this time, Ronni was happy to have Sleeknote as a tool and the Managed Solution team for assistance.</p>



<p>“It made a lot of sense for us to have Sleeknote during our mid-season sale where we had four different campaigns running,” says Ronni. “One [campaign] without a countdown timer at the beginning of the sale, and one at the end of the sale to increase urgency. These two campaigns were created for both desktop and mobile individually.” But that’s not even the best part.</p>



<p>“I was on vacation at the time of the sale. But with the advanced scheduling option and Managed Solution’s help, I was able to let go of the reins, knowing everything would be on track and run smoothly.”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="230" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2.jpg" alt="A Flexible Tool for Mid-Season Sale Sleekbox 2" class="wp-image-95509" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2.jpg 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-380x146.jpg 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-91x35.jpg 91w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-130x50.jpg 130w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-220x84.jpg 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A-Flexible-Tool-for-Mid-Season-Sale-Sleekbox-2-385x148.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The campaign with a countdown timer <strong>increased conversions by 215.09%</strong> and the campaign without the countdown timer saw <strong>an increase of 216.98%</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A More Effective Way to Collect Leads</h2>



<p>With 19 physical stores, it’s been difficult for Kings &amp; Queens to control their newsletter signups from their KingsQueens.dk’ headquarters.</p>



<p>Ronni explains: “Before we started using Sleeknote, we only collected leads in our physical stores and they weren’t coming in consistently. With the new Sleeknote campaign on our site, we know that every visitor is presented with the opportunity to sign up. This is much more effective than being dependent on the sales assistants in the stores who don’t always remember to ask.”</p>

<h2>The Value of Email Marketing</h2>



<p>When it comes to online marketing, your email list is one of your most valuable resources. In fact, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Email-Continues-Deliver-Strong-ROI-Value-Marketers/1014461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one study</a> found that emails are the most cost efficient online marketing channel, having an average ROI of 122%.</p>



<p>Horze’ marketing strategy is focused on many channels but one of the biggest is their email contacts. Recently, the marketing team invested in a new ESP system and lead generation is crucial in order to reach their KPI goals and succeed.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Horze Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Soon after using Sleeknote, Horze on-page conversion rate went from 2% to 5%. This alone would have been a satisfying achievement, but they decided to push forward and see how high the conversion could get. To do this, they explored the A/B testing feature and saw an increase in the on-page conversion rate from 6.7% to 26.9%.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Horze Grew Their Email List Using Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Horze used Sleeknote to get qualified leads for their newsletter. The first way they did this was by offering discounts to new visitors.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>They also created competitions and split test different prizes to determine which were most likely to convince visitors to subscribe to their newsletter.</p>



<p>A perfect example of this is the A/B test for offering a winter turnout blanket versus a gift card, which showed that using the gift card as a prize increased the conversion rate by 298%.</p>

<h2>Big Brother</h2>



<p>Boozt.com has built a well-known brand in the Nordic countries over the last nine years, as a premium store. Three years ago, they started expanding into the mid-range price segment through a new outlet, Booztlet.com.</p>



<p>Over these three years, Booztlet’s massive growth has taken the company by storm. In fact, their current predictions place Booztlet as a growth driver for the entire company, over the next three-to-five years. This makes maintaining and accelerating growth a top priority for Kim Vile, Boozt’s E-Commerce Director.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Growing Pains</h2>



<p>As a new company, establishing a fast pace of growth is natural, but maintaining it throughout the years is the real challenge. The common view of growth identifies two key processes: acquiring new customers and retaining old ones.</p>



<p>Booztlet tackles the mid-range price segment, so a big part of their sales revolve around special offers, discounts, and deals. At first, they ran weekly campaigns on their site, including special deals and discounts that all of their visitors had access to. While they had a positive impact on sales, these campaigns did little in terms of customer retention. To use them to their full potential, Kim Vile turned them into incentives for signing up to the company’s newsletter, by making them exclusive to subscribers. In doing so, he created a “low-key loyalty membership.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Booztlet Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet uses their newsletter to create desire and interest through new collections and special deals sent to subscribers, as well as improving their on-site experience through direct access to their weekly campaigns. As of writing, it accounts for half of the company’s sales, making it a crucial part of their marketing strategy. The strategy for the newsletter is even more ambitious in the long run, aiming to introduce more personalized campaigns and on-site interactions for subscribers down the line. In either case, it plays—and will continue to play—a major role in Booztlet’s marketing strategy in the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In order to increase newsletter signups, Kim looked for ways to engage visitors on-site and make opting in simple. “I’m using Sleeknote for its rules,” Kim told me. “It’s just so easy to set when, where and how often to show your campaigns. Without any technical knowledge, you can set up a campaign within five minutes.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Booztlet Used Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Booztlet turned their weekly campaigns into incentives for signing up to their newsletter, by making the best deals and discounts exclusive to subscribers. They did this in two ways: by sending them newsletters about the latest offers, as well as using cookies on-site to differentiate between new visitors and subscribers. In doing so, subscribers were given access to the discounts immediately, while new visitors were shown the SleekBox below.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="624" height="292" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png" alt="Booztlet-SleekBox-1" class="wp-image-95483" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1.png 624w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-300x140.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-380x178.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-600x281.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-75x35.png 75w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-107x50.png 107w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-220x103.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Booztlet-SleekBox-1-385x180.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This simple concept proved to be extremely effective, generating leads for Booztlet’s newsletter on their international site, as well as their specific Danish, Finnish and Swedish sites.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they used Sleeknote’s cookie tracking capabilities to show on-site messages and offers only to their newsletter subscribers. One example is the SleekBar below they used to showcase a “Get 4, Pay only for 3” exclusive deal to visitors holding the “subscriber” cookie.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>By tweaking a system Booztlet already had in place, namely their weekly campaigns, and turning it into a signup incentive, they were able to not only increase sales but keep their existing customers interested and coming back for new deals and discounts.</p>



<p>Boozlet’s position as a growth driver for a company as massive as Boozt proves how far leveraging your assets to their full potential can go. New traffic and sales are always a great place to start, but returning customers and loyalty are the pillars of a true market leader.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>



<p>As with many online stores, Pilgrim wanted to grow their email list with relevant email leads. They needed a tool that was easy to customize and offered the flexibility to target visitors in different languages on their different sites.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Collecting Relevant Emails</h2>



<p>To incentivize visitors to sign up for their newsletter, Pilgrim offers a 10% discount on visitors’ first purchase.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This popup is shown on Pilgrim’s inspiration pages where visitors can find inspiration for how to style their jewellery.</p>



<p>These pages are optimized for Google rankings, so when visitors search Google for certain phrases related to Pilgrim’s product line, such as ‘gold jewellery’, it’s the inspiration pages that visitors see first.</p>



<p>This campaign is especially effective on these pages because visitors looking for inspiration on jewellery are more likely to also be interested in getting inspiration and offers from Pilgrim in their inbox.</p>



<p>Pilgrim’s website has been translated into the languages of its target markets and so has its newsletter campaign.</p>



<p>Translating the campaign into different languages has resulted in almost half the visitors on the inspiration pages converting into email leads on the Swedish (50%), German (47%), and the Norwegian (37%) site.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, these campaigns have generated more than 65,000 leads.</p>



<p>Pilgrim also tested a time-limited campaign. In this campaign, they partnered with Boozt to test a different incentive. Visitors were offered a chance to win two tickets to a Boozt fashion show and a gift card to use on Pilgrim’s online store.</p>



<p>Pilgrim used a Facebook ad to generate traffic to the landing page with the offer. If visitors wanted the offer, they had to click a link to trigger the email popup:</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign produced a conversion rate of <strong>76%.</strong></p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A Pleasant Surprise</h2>



<p>Pilgrim also wanted to see if they could turn abandoning visitors into email leads by using an exit-intent popup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months ago, they decided to try it, and created an exit-intent campaign offering a 10% discount in exchange for an email address.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Since implementing Sleeknote, Pilgrim has collected more than 67,000 new email leads for their newsletter across all their sites.</p>



<p>They continue to experiment with new features to ensure they always have the best performing campaigns on their site.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Cart Abandonment</h2>



<p>Cart abandonment is a real problem for online retailers. In fact, according to<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Statista</a>, 75,6% of all online shopping carts are abandoned at checkout, resulting in lost sales and revenue. “I had a challenge with the cart abandonment rate being too high on both sites,” Anders told me. “That’s the reason I looked into Sleeknote—to figure out a way to reduce it.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Minimum Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>Before using Sleeknote, Minimum had developed their own popup software. While it allowed them to include basic popups on their site, it lacked the ability to target prospects at a specific moment in the buyer’s journey. Anders wanted to find a solution he could use on both minimum.dk and moves.dk that could be customized to target the individual visitor without hurting the user experience.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;Before we used Sleeknote, we had our own popup. Just a thing that we developed ourselves. And that worked fine, but the disadvantage is that when you develop something yourself, it doesn’t contain the same rules, logic, figures, and features Sleeknote does.&#8221;    </blockquote>

<h2>How Minimum Reduced Their Cart Abandonment Rate</h2>



<p>In order to convince visitors to complete the checkout, Anders knew he needed a way to reach them before they left, and show them a compelling offer. “What we basically did was offer a 10% discount in a SleekBox on both sites to help abandoning visitors complete their order.”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="673" height="405" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2.png" alt="Sleekbox1" class="wp-image-95315" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2.png 673w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-300x181.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-380x229.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-600x361.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-58x35.png 58w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-83x50.png 83w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-220x132.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox1-2-385x232.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Minimum achieved two things with the above approach. “We got the email address, increasing our newsletter database, and then we got visitors to complete their order, so we got a lot of orders, too.” In doing so, they not only ensured that customers completed their orders, but they also increased the chances of extra sales through long-term email marketing.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>By using a cart recovery <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank">SleekBox with an exit-intent trigger</a>, Minimum achieved a conversion rate of 39.5%, thus reducing the cart abandonment rate and generating 9.362 leads for their newsletter.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2>A Brand Built on People</h2>



<p>In 2003, Munk Store started as a physical retailer for clothes and sneakers, covering a wide range of Danish and international brands. Their value proposition revolved around the social aspect of shopping, by cultivating a strong relationship with their customers. They actively encourage employees to show their own personalities and engage with visitors beyond “shop talk”, thus emphasizing the people behind the company.</p>



<p>By 2011, they embraced the online revolution and built their own webshop. While this enabled them to grow beyond their physical locations, it also raised a big issue—the social values at the core of their brand were based on employees’ interactions with customers, which couldn’t be replicated within an online store.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Upholding The Values</h2>



<p>To ensure the online experience provided the same value as the in-store one, Munk Store had to build a deeply personal online presence. Doing this required adopting channels beyond their own platform, with social media playing a key role in their strategy. So again, they encouraged employees to showcase themselves and their personalities through these new channels.</p>



<p>The following image was part of a Christmas delivery announcement from Munk Store’s Instagram page, featuring the employee in charge of sending out the packages:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="732" height="474" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image.png" alt="Upholding The Values Image" class="wp-image-95207" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image.png 732w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-300x194.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-400x260.png 400w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-380x246.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-600x389.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-54x35.png 54w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-77x50.png 77w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-220x142.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Upholding-The-Values-Image-385x249.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Unexpected Benefits</h2>



<p>While the online store was active, Munk Store discovered something fascinating–their online presence was actually bringing more people into their physical stores. Andreas Lodahl, their E-Commerce Manager, told me that “shopping online is growing rapidly, but people still prefer to hold a product in their hands before buying it. So if they see something interesting online, they will come to the store to try it on.”</p>



<p>To take full advantage of this discovery, they expanded their social media presence through Snapchat. Their goal on the platform was simple: “We wanted to make sure that if someone followed us on Snapchat, they would know our employees’ names within a week,” Andreas told me. To support this, Munk Store’semployees have been posting on Snapchat daily, with the following posts being their latest ones as of writing:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="234" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image.png" alt="Unexpected Benefits Image" class="wp-image-95203" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image-300x185.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image-57x35.png 57w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image-81x50.png 81w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unexpected-Benefits-Image-220x135.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Aside from humanizing the store in the online medium, this approach allowed Munk Store to diversify their promotional messages. They could change the traditional “Check Out This New Collection!” with “Check Out Mikkel’s Favourite Sweater!” attaching personal value to the products.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Building a Following</h2>



<p>Munk Store wanted Snapchat to be their most personal social media platform. To do so, they had to make sure their followers were interested in the store–otherwise the daily posts might have been seen as annoying. So they focused on their website’s visitors, who had proven their interest in the company simply by being on the site. Andreas targeted them through the following SleekBox:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="226" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image.png" alt="Building a Following Image" class="wp-image-95183" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image-300x178.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image-59x35.png 59w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image-84x50.png 84w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Building-a-Following-Image-220x131.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While the correlation between Snapchat and in-store traffic was difficult to measure, the employees asked customers where they first saw the product they were buying. And “Snapchat” was the answer more often than expected, assuring Munk Store that their strategy was working.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec26dc3e5a8b" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Generating Leads</h2>



<p>Outside of social media, email marketing was also a growing platform for Munk Store. While being a relatively new addition compared to the rest of their sales channels, it already accounted for 6% of their sales in 2018.</p>



<p>Due to their focus on personalized customer interactions, they avoid the standard newsletter format sent out to entire mailing lists. Instead, they opt for personalized email flows.</p>



<p>The most obvious way they segment their mailing list is by gender as visitors sign up to the newsletter. Certain behaviors, such as leaving the website with items in the cart also trigger special mail flows, reminding the user to complete their order.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="245" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image.png" alt="Generating Leads Image" class="wp-image-95187" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image-300x193.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image-54x35.png 54w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image-78x50.png 78w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Generating-Leads-Image-220x142.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Reducing Cart Abandonment</h2>



<p>While Munk Store connects with its customers more than most stores, they are not immune to the issue many online retailers face–the dreaded cart abandonment. With an average of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">74.2%</a> of online shopping carts being abandoned, Andreas knew they needed a way to convince potential customers to complete their orders.</p>



<p>His solution to this issue was simple, yet very effective. Using the Exit Intent trigger, he offered visitors about to leave their carts a discount on their purchase, through the following SleekBox:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="248" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image.png" alt="Reducing Cart Abandonment Image" class="wp-image-95199" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image-300x196.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image-54x35.png 54w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image-77x50.png 77w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reducing-Cart-Abandonment-Image-220x144.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>According to Andreas, when presented with this offer, 50% of visitors completed their purchase on the spot. Those who signed up and left anyway went through a personalized email flow, which reminded them of the items left in their cart while also presenting alternative products that might suit their needs better. The exact results of the email flows were not registered, but they certainly added to the already impressive 50% completion rate.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec26dffe5a8d" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        “Our exit-intent campaigns drive a lot of revenue to our stores that would have otherwise been lost!”    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DSC06216-2-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="DSC06216-2" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DSC06216-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DSC06216-2-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">

            <span class="customer-title">E-commerce Manager</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Munkstore’s Results</h2>



<p>Snapchat makes it difficult to accurately assess the size of one’s following. However, Munk Store estimates 5-6,000 followers, which bring additional traffic and contribute to sales in their physical stores. In terms of email marketing leads, roughly 69.5% of their mailing list was signed up through a Sleeknote campaign, with the list contributing to overall sales by 6%. Additionally, they managed to considerably reduce cart abandonment on their website.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Building an online platform represents a paradigm shift for any retailer, affecting everything from the supply chain all the way to customer interactions. If the brand is built around the products, preserving its identity in the online medium is quite straightforward–you simply have to adapt the same image and messages to a new platform. As Munk Store’s identity is linked to in-store interactions with employees, this change of platform was a lot more complicated.</p>



<p>By aligning their online communication channels and content in a way that promoted the people behind the company, Munk Store managed to stay true to its core values and as Andreas put it, “attach some faces to the company.” The strategy that has worked so well for them in physical stores has been paying off in the online medium as well, with the company having registered a revenue growth of 25% in 2018. They even took it further, by leveraging their new social media presence to increase foot traffic and sales in their physical stores.</p>



<p>Most companies try to diversify their values and chase multiple ideals, but only as they suit their situation. While this could work in the short term, Munk Store’s case is a perfect example of what can be accomplished when a company aligns itself with a value and upholds it regardless of obstacles.</p>

<h2>It’s All About Priorities</h2>



<p>Vinga of Sweden creates a wide collection of well-designed, functional products for its customer’s homes. Their business works in three main directions: (1) Business-to-Business (B2B) sales of products to third-party retailers, (2) Business-to-Consumer (B2C) sales of products through their webshop, and (3) B2B sales of gift cards to retailers. All these sides of the business are interconnected, with B2B sales accounting for the larger part of the company’s revenue.</p>



<p>However, in order for retailers to be interested in selling their products, consumers need to know the brand and create demand for it. As such, generating brand awareness has always been a priority for the company, with the latest initiative for doing so being an Instagram campaign.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Vinga of Sweden Chose Sleeknote</h2>



<p>A stronger social media presence results in more brand awareness, which in turn generates more demand for Vinga of Sweden’s products. Through a quantifiable metric, such as the number of social media followers, the company could more easily persuade retailers to offer their products.</p>



<p>Niklas Larsson, Vinga of Sweden’s E-Commerce Manager, had a clear vision for how the campaign should work. He explained that “We wanted visitors to click on the message and follow our Instagram page. It was important that after they came back, we could show them another message, thanking them and displaying the discount code we promised.”</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Building A Following</h2>



<p>They created a simple campaign revealing that Instagram followers got a 15% discount on their first purchase. To ensure all visitors saw this message without intruding on the user experience, Niklas cleverly combined the 10% scroll and exit intent triggers. As such, if the user was naturally browsing the page, the campaign would trigger once they scrolled down 10% of the page. However, if they wanted to leave before going down the 10%, the exit intent trigger took over and showed the campaign regardless.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="380" height="461" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6.png" alt="Sleekbox 1#" class="wp-image-95137" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6-247x300.png 247w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6-29x35.png 29w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6-41x50.png 41w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-6-220x267.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This combination proved extremely effective, as 20.1% of visitors clicked through this SleekBox. After they returned from Vinga of Sweden’s Instagram page, they were presented with the following message:</p>

<h2>A New Form of Communication</h2>



<p>Aside from using Sleeknote to improve brand awareness, Vinga of Sweden also uses it as a communication channel with their B2B customers. Niklas explained that “Almost everybody goes through the website, so we can quickly send out messages through it.” They do this for both urgent messages, such as technical issues the company is facing, or simply general updates relevant to visitors. The following is an example of a message displayed when the company’s phone line was down:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="600" height="221" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem.png" alt="Notification Of Technical Prolem" class="wp-image-95133" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-300x111.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-380x140.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-95x35.png 95w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-136x50.png 136w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-220x81.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-385x142.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>Through these types of on-site messages, Vinga of Sweden established a new communication channel with their visitors and customers, enabling them to quickly broadcast short, but important messages. Before implementing Sleeknote, these messages were handled directly through their web platform, a process that Niklas told me “involved a lot of steps just to add something simple to the site. With Sleeknote, we can change it quickly, straight from the editor.”</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>As marketers, we tend to focus on tangible values. We convert, we sell, we measure. While these values are easy to quantify and make it easy to monitor our success, they tend to blind us to the importance of softer values. We tend to disregard social media followings as “vanity metrics” and choose to ignore their meaning, as they are hard to quantify. Any marketer would take 10 sales over 100 followers without blinking. But what if it’s not so simple? What if, sometimes, we can be wrong?</p>



<p>Vinga of Sweden’s case is a perfect example of soft, “vanity metrics” having a strong, albeit indirect contribution to sales. As they primarily sell to other businesses, the value of these sales is beyond what any end user would purchase. From the outside, it might seem wasteful to aim for Instagram followers instead of newsletter subscribers, but in Vinga of Sweden’s case, the demand they generated resulted in more sales than an email marketing list could have.</p>

<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>First of all, we needed a solution to win back the customers who were about to abandon the cart.</p>



<p>We found out that we could use Sleeknote for this, and signed up for a free trial. We quickly saw how effective Sleeknote was, so we kept on using it. Since then we’ve also discovered all the other opportunities Sleeknote offers.</p>



<p>Another reason why we chose Sleeknote is that it’s very user-friendly compared to other lead generation tools. Everyone can create a sleeknote – Let me give you an example:</p>



<p>Earlier today, I asked one of our interns to create a SleekBox on a landing page for Fjällräven, where a SleekBox should pop up and offer a discount code to customers coming from a specific page. It was the first time she used Sleeknote, and she created the SleekBox without any problems. I’m not lying when I tell you that she was shocked at how easy it was.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Do You Use Sleeknote for Today?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Exit-intent SleekBox</h3>



<p>Whenever we are doing marketing, we try to include Sleeknote in some way.</p>



<p>Sometimes we make Sleeknote campaigns with<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank"> the exit-intent trigger</a> that shows whenever our customers are about to leave our site. Then a popup shows up offering a 5% discount code. Actually, we called the discount code SN5 (Sleeknote 5). That discount code gained a lot of revenue from customers about to leave the site.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Collecting Leads</h3>



<p>Obviously, we also use Sleeknote to grow our email list. It has helped us harvest a lot of emails and has performed very well!</p>



<p>We also use Sleeknote on our landing pages, when we do AdWords. Instead of putting discount codes all over the landing page, we use Sleeknote to put some conditions on it. for example, If we have an Ad for “Cheap prams”, we isolate a few prams on the landing page and combine it with a time activated SleekBox that offers a discount code after a short time. This method has generated a lot of sales!</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a SleekBox on Pixizoo’s website:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="344" height="439" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1.png" alt="pixizoo-sleekbox1" class="wp-image-94846" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1.png 344w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1-235x300.png 235w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1-27x35.png 27w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1-39x50.png 39w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pixizoo-sleekbox1-220x281.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>3. Service Announcement</h3>



<p>Lastly, I would like to mention how we have used Sleeknote to deliver service messages. If our phones at customer service don’t work, we can easily put a service announcement on our website saying “Our phones are temporarily down, please wait 30 min. before calling us”. It is easy to implement because we always have a SleekBox with an announcement ready to activate, and the SleekBox is very easy to adjust. The service message creates a much better understanding of our customers than if we didn’t have anything on our site. I think Sleeknote works quite excellent and is very user-friendly.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>Definitely the time management function! I actually remember that we wrote to you suggesting this feature, and you created it shortly after. It is great to see that you take feedback seriously.</p>



<p>We often use this function when we run campaigns. For example, if we run a campaign offering a 10% discount on the entire webshop from 6-12 pm, I don’t have to activate the SleekBox at 6 pm and turn it off at 12 pm. That’s smart!</p>



<p>It’s also a major advantage that we can manage the SleekBox by sources and UTM codes.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>The number of signups for our newsletter has exploded since we started using Sleeknote.</p>



<p>The cart abandonment SleekBox has also performed great and has really helped us to make sales to customers who otherwise would have left the cart. We can’t measure the exact conversion rate since we’re using a discount code and not a CTA button on that sleeknote, but we’ve compared how many views the site has with the number of times the discount code has been used – And the result showed exactly why Sleeknote is worth the money we spend on it.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Would You Recommend, If I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>If I were to try Sleeknote as a new customer, I would follow these steps:</p>



<p>1. Think about what the purpose of your SleekBoxes is – What should your SleekBoxes do?</p>



<p>2. Go to Google Analytics and find out where on your website your SleekBoxes should be placed.</p>



<p>3. Book a Best Practice meeting with the Sleeknote team – It’s 15 minutes well spent.</p>



<p>4. Start building your SleekBox in the drag-n-drop editor.</p>



<p>Sleeknote is insanely easy to use. It’s just about having the idea of how to use it and some traffic on your website – Then you’re ready to utilize Sleeknote.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>It couldn’t be better. I’ve written to you a few times, and every time you’ve responded quickly and with all the information I needed.</p>



<p>I’d also like to mention, that I follow a few forums about ecommerce, and you’re very good at answering questions on these forums and to be objective at the same time. You’re not just telling people to choose Sleeknote, but instead, you say “feel free to choose the competitor, but we can do this”.</p>



<p>Overall, your team seems awesome and that’s also what I’ve heard other marketers say about you.</p>

<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Sleeknote is simply the best. We researched the different options on Google, and Sleeknote just appealed to us. A colleague of mine had also followed Mogens Møller (CEO of Sleeknote) and knew that Mogens really knows what he’s doing. So it was, in fact, Mogens’ personal brand that made the decision for us. He is a quality stamp for Sleeknote.</p>



<p>We have later discovered how user-friendly the product is, and that your customer service is great.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Was the Implementation of Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>It was really easy because Sleeknote did it for us. We wanted to get started quickly, and Sleeknote offered to do the implementation for us, so we gladly accepted that offer.</p>



<p>This way we make our SleekBoxes much more personal, and it doesn’t really take much extra time to set it up like this.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Increasing Sales</h3>



<p>It depends on what mood we’re in. By that I mean, if we’re aggressive in our sales methods, we might make a more aggressive SleekBox, to make sure that our visitors don’t miss our offer. An example could be to inform our visitors that it is much cheaper to buy more tees.</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Collecting Leads</h3>



<p>Other times, we use it to generate leads, through competitions for example. We usually don’t use these at the same time as a SleekBox with sales, or discounts.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a SleekBox on Teeshoppen’s website:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="722" height="376" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2.png" alt="teeshoppen sleekbox 2" class="wp-image-94833" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2.png 722w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-300x156.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-380x198.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-600x312.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-67x35.png 67w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-96x50.png 96w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-220x115.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/teeshoppen-sleekbox-2-385x200.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>3. Providing Customer Service</h3>



<p>We also have specific SleekBoxes for specific pages on our site. These work as a service to our visitors. We use them to ask if they need help, or if they have any questions regarding a specific product.</p>



<p>So basically, we use Sleeknote to collect emails and to provide good customer service. The cool thing about Sleeknote is that you can use it for pretty much anything – The only limit is your imagination.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>I think it’s really cool that you can decide how many times a visitor should see your SleekBox. Also, the integration with MailChimp is really awesome, because you don’t need to be an IT expert to make it work.</p>



<p>I often use my iPad or phone to set up new SleekBoxes, and that works really well too.</p>



<p>Another great feature is the option to activate a SleekBoxes at a specific time and date. We try to segment as much as possible with Sleeknote, and if we, for example, run a campaign with free shipping on one specific day, we can create different SleekBoxes depending on the time of day. So from 7am-10am, we have a SleekBox with the text: “Goodmorning. If you shop before 12 pm today, you get free shipping”. From 12pm-6pm: “Hey, hope you’re having a great day. Today we’ll pay for your shipping”. Then at night, we have one saying: “Good evening night owls – shop before everyone else, and get free shipping (the offer is valid until 7 am)”.</p>



<p>This way we make our SleekBoxes much more personal, and it doesn’t really take much extra time to set it up like this.</p>

<p>When Teeshoppen ran a campaign with a SleekBox promoting their package deals, they increased their sales by around 300% compared to the previous period.</p>

<h2>What Do You Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Collecting Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>Our main purpose with Sleeknote is to get more subscribers for our newsletter. One of the ways we do this is by creating competitions. As an example, we have an opt-in saying “Sign up for our newsletter to win a year’s supply of hummel”. What’s really smart about Sleeknote is that we’re able to create boxes where the subscriber can choose what they would like to get news about. This helps us a lot in the segmentation process and ensures that we only send relevant emails.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2. Redirecting to a Campaign Site</h3>



<p>We have also used Sleeknote to redirect our visitors to a certain campaign page. We created an opt-in with a competition saying something like “Click here to participate in the competition” with a link to the particular site. This created a lot of traffic to the campaign page where we promoted our, at that time, sponsorship with the German football club FC St. Pauli along with the club’s jerseys and footballs.</p>

<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>It’s hard to choose one particular feature because there are so many features.</p>



<p>In general, Sleeknote is very user-friendly. It’s a great feature that you’re able to see your changes right away when you design your sleeknote. This makes the whole process of designing opt-ins much easier.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>We use Sleeknote in a lot of countries and they all have different conversion rates, but on average the conversion rate is around 2%. The two countries where our sleeknotes perform best are Denmark and Turkey, where we’ve collected 24,000+ new leads.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Would You Recommend, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Don’t wait, just get started.</p>



<p>We used Sleeknote before I was hired, but it was very easy for me to put my personal stamp on the SleekBoxes we already had and to create new SleekBoxes later on.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>Absolutely great. Your support has a short response time and is very good at solving problems.</p>

<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>I started using Sleeknote back when it was called Twami. People started talking about popups, and I had to try it out myself. I implemented Sleeknote on my website and have been using it ever since.</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec25cb22f8c5" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        “I know there are other companies who also provides popups or slide-ins, but I know what I get with Sleeknote – Quality, service and a tool that simply works.&#8221;    </blockquote>

            <span class="customer-name">Majbritt Lund</span>
            <span class="customer-title">Founder, Majbrittlund.dk</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are You Using Sleeknote for Today?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Collecting Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>I primarily use Sleeknote to get sign-ups for my newsletters.</p>



<p>What’s most important is that the SleekBox is relevant to the page it appears on.</p>



<p>I used the same SleekBox on all my pages at the start, but now I have 7 different SleekBoxes that slide in on the most relevant sites. This means that if a visitor is reading about a SEO course on my website, a SleekBox appears and offers a free e-book about SEO. If another visitor is reading about newsletters, a SleekBox shows up and offers a webinar about newsletters and sales texts, if that’s what I’m offering at that point.</p>



<p>Here is an example of sleeknote from her website. The sleeknote has a conversion rate of 4,8 %.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="574" height="274" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow.png" alt="majbrittlund-Sleekbow" class="wp-image-94816" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow.png 574w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-300x143.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-380x181.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-73x35.png 73w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-105x50.png 105w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-220x105.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/majbrittlund-Sleekbow-385x184.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>2.&nbsp; Providing Customer Service</h3>



<p>I also use Sleeknote as a contact box, and that has actually been very successful. I use it as an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank">exit-intent SleekBox</a> and offer my visitors 15-min free advice from me. My visitors also have the possibility to write a question in the contact box, which shows them that they’re welcome to reach out to me without spending any money. The contact box shows reliability and openness, which is an important factor for my business and my customers.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Feature?</h2>



<p>My favorite Sleeknote feature is that it is possible to have different sleeknotes! If you customize your sleeknotes strategically to specific pages, you’re able to make your visitors do exactly what you want them to do.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>In general, my SleekBoxes have a conversion rate between 3 and 7%.</p>



<p>The best performing SleekBox on my website has a conversion rate of 6,5% and has acquired +300 leads.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, If I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>The first thing you should do is to spend one hour to be inspired by other great sleeknotes. Afterwards, you should book a best practice meeting with Sleeknote’s customer success team, and then you’re good to go.</p>



<p>Another advice is that if you have difficulties with IT and graphics, you should consider hiring a graphic designer to create your first sleeknote. You only need to do this once, because when the first sleeknote is created, it’s very easy to make changes and adjust the sleeknote, even if you’re not really into IT and graphics.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>WeMarket needed a user-friendly tool tool to generate leads and signups for their newsletter.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>As a Digital Marketing Bureau, What Are Your Thoughts about Email Marketing?</h2>



<p>Email works well for almost everyone. If it doesn’t work it’s because the design and message in your newsletter aren’t good enough. Our experience is that email as a platform works very well, and that’s why it’s important to get a large and relevant database of subscribers you can send your mail to.</p>



<p>When we get a new customer, we often implement Sleeknote as one of the first things in order to get more subscribers to their newsletter.</p>



<p>We tested a few other lead generation tools, but none of the other tools were as user friendly as Sleeknote. Even though some of your competitors have lower prices, we would lose money by using them because we would need to spend much more time on managing the popups, and that’s why we chose Sleeknote.</p>



<p>Since then you’ve added a lot of features and delivered fantastic service, so we are very satisfied with our choice.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Why Did You Choose Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Basically, we needed a tool to generate leads and signups for our newsletter. We were looking for a user-friendly tool that everyone at our office was able to manage. This is very important as everyone at our office needs to be able to change the popups right away if our customers ask us to do that – That’s part of our service.</p>



<p>We tested a few other lead generation tools, but none of the other tools were as user friendly as Sleeknote. Even though some of your competitors have lower prices, we would lose money by using them because we would need to spend much more time on managing the popups, and that’s why we chose Sleeknote.</p>



<p>Since then you’ve added a lot of features and delivered fantastic service, so we are very satisfied with our choice.</p>

<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Increasing Newsletter Subscriptions</h2>



<p>We use Sleeknote to get signups for our newsletter and to generate leads.</p>



<p>We use <a href="https://sleeknote.com/features/exit-intent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exit-intent to generate email signups</a>. When they have signed up, they automatically enter an email flow that sends tips and tricks in a very personalized style.</p>



<p>We have also had another SleekBox on WeMarket telling our customers to sign up and get a free written examination of their company. We actually had to disable that SleekBox because it generated more leads than we were able to handle.</p>



<p>Obviously, the leads we got weren’t as good as those who call us directly, but it’s a good way to get leads from those who just visit our website. We’ve done A/B split testing of our SleekBoxes, and we clearly see that social proof works brilliantly, and that is probably why the SleekBox performed so well.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is Your Favorite Sleeknote Function or Option?</h2>



<p>That you’re able to customize your sleeknotes just the way you want it. We have a wide range of customers and it is a major advantage that we can create completely different sleeknotes. Ultimately, you have a sleeknote tailored to each site with a specific purpose.</p>



<p>Another feature I appreciate is the exclude/include URL function. As an example, it wouldn’t make any sense if the visitors from our facebook gets a popup saying “Follow us on Facebook”.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Are Your Results with Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>If we disable Sleeknote we get 2-5% fewer leads each day than we do with a SleekBox activated – And that’s the same for our customers.</p>



<p>An interesting fact is that we end up with a sale to a lot of the leads who sign up via a SleekBox, so it gives a high number of qualified leads.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Describe Sleeknote with Your Own Words.</h2>



<p>Sleeknote is very user friendly. It has a broad appeal, which means that it is a great tool for all businesses no matter the size or level of ambition. You simply adjust your sleeknotes to your specific needs and requirements. Even a small business with limited IT skills could easily implement Sleeknote, which they wouldn’t be able to with a WordPress plugin for example.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Advice Would You Give Me, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>The most important thing is to set up your sleeknote and give it a fair chance. Each day, around 97% of your visitors leave your site without leaving a trace. If you use Google AdWords for example, you have already paid for the click – so why not try to convert your visitors into leads? Sleeknote enhances the effect of your other marketing channels.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>Whenever I contact you, I get the feeling that you are ready to help me. You have short response time and outstanding service.</p>

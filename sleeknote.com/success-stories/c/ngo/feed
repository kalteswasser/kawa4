<h2>What About Us?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Studies </a>show that Denmark ranks as the third country in the world for the prevalence of multiple sclerosis, with an average of 227 people out of 100,000 suffering from it. This number grows tenfold if you consider how sclerosis impacts the lives of direct sufferers, their families, and close friends.</p>



<p>The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Society (Scleroseforeningen)’s mission is to help improve the quality of life for people affected by sclerosis and their families. They do this by financing research in the field, offering free counseling sessions, as well as keeping people up to date on the latest discoveries through a quarterly magazine.</p>



<p>The biggest political issue they encounter is that sclerosis is not given enough consideration by the Danish government. In the case of cancer, children of patients are offered special benefits and support from the state. This is not the case for sclerosis, despite the similarly devastating impact it can have on families.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>It Starts With One Step</h2>



<p>Inflicting change in a political environment is an enormous task, but Scleroseforeningen took it upon themselves to fight for the rights of the sufferers. They knew that changing the regulation would be a long-term goal at the end of a long journey, so they started this process the only way they could—by taking the first step.</p>



<p>Klaus Ibsen Bloch, Scleroseforeningen’s Digital Project Manager, told me: “The first step was getting political attention and setting the tone of voice. It’s a long shot, but we’re working on it, and if we’re lucky, we’ll get this through in a year or two.”</p>



<p>To get this political attention, they turned to members of the Society and people who were interested in the topic, gathering signatures for a petition. Since most of the target group were already visiting their website, Klaus needed a way to leverage that traffic and make those visitors aware of the petition.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>By researching what other companies have been doing in similar situations, Klaus found on-site messages were a go-to solution. As Sleeknote offers discounts for non-profit organizations (NGOs), he decided to use it to promote the petition. He created the following campaign, which directed visitors to the form they needed to fill in for the petition.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="273" height="382" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1.png" alt="sleekbox1" class="wp-image-95024" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1.png 273w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1-214x300.png 214w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1-25x35.png 25w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1-36x50.png 36w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox1-1-220x308.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>This campaign helped Scleroseforeningen collect 2,500 signatures for their petition, accounting for 25% of the society’s current members. The success of this campaign proved that people wanted families affected by sclerosis to be given more support. This fact gives them a strong foundation to build their case upon and takes Scleroseforeningen one step closer to getting the change in regulation approved.</p>



<p>Being an NGO, Scleroseforeningen relies on donations to function. They sign up contributors through Facebook ads and their newsletter. In order to improve their on-site signup rates, they ran campaigns on their website asking visitors for their name, email address, and phone number, as shown in the example below:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="360" height="376" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2.png" alt="sleekbox2" class="wp-image-95028" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2.png 360w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2-287x300.png 287w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2-34x35.png 34w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2-48x50.png 48w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleekbox2-2-220x230.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Furthermore, they also used a Guide Your Visitor campaign to enhance the on-site customer journey, by offering easy access to relevant pages.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Every journey, no matter how long or difficult, begins with a first step, regardless of whether you have a small business trying to make it’s way to the market or an established NGO trying to change political regulations.</p>



<p>To begin with, Scleroseforeningen’s task seemed impossible, but as they took steps in that direction, their vision became closer to reality than ever before. This petition was a first courageous step in a chain of events that will bring a meaningful change in people’s lives, and get families affected by sclerosis the support they need and deserve, to live a better life.</p>

<h2>What Do You Use Sleeknote for Today?</h2>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Collecting Newsletter Subscribers</h3>



<p>At the moment we are mainly using Sleeknote to get our visitors to sign up for our monthly newsletter. We use the SleekBox opt-in forms as they are very easy to implement and require no coding.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>2. Volunteer Sign-Ups</h2>



<p>Moreover, we also used SleekBoxes doing our annual national door-to-door collection. One of our challenges was that some visitors left our sign-up form without signing up. As 90% of our traffic came in a timespan of two weeks, it was not possible to set up a proper A/B-test. By using a SleekBox saying “Do you need help with signing up? Leave your number and we will call you” we had an alternative solution to our problem.</p>



<p>The SleekBox gave us a lot of registrations, we otherwise would have failed to collect without Sleeknote. It was viewed 4443 times before we disabled it again, and gave us 182 new registrations which resulted in a conversion rate of 4,1%. Considering that each collector on average collected more than a 1,000,- on that day, a quick calculation would be that Sleeknote potentially helped us collect 182,000,- which are used saving lives every day.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>What Is the Best Thing about Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Sleeknote is very user-friendly, which means that you are able to test new ideas in no time.</p>



<p>Moreover, SleekBoxes can also be useful to direct visitors to specific pages on your website that normally would be hard to find. By doing that, it’s possible to raise awareness on specific causes in a given period.</p>

<h2>What Would You Recommend, if I Were to Try Sleeknote?</h2>



<p>Just get started, it’s so easy to implement.</p>



<p>Also, try to consider alternative ways in which Sleeknote can be used. It can be used for so much more than just email subscription and lead generation. For instance, Sleeknote can also be used to provide visitors with useful information, like a help box, or it can be used to redirect visitors to other pages on your website – e.g. during a campaign.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How Has the Collaboration with Sleeknote Been?</h2>



<p>The support team has been really helpful – both in email and on phone. I’ve called the customer support one time, and the agent I talked to understood my problem and provided a solution quickly. In general, he was super helpful so I only have good experiences with Sleeknote.</p>

<h2>What do they use Sleeknote for?</h2>



<p>Red Cross is a great example of using SleekBoxes for creating awareness to either a specific page or a specific theme.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>Recruiting Volunteers</h3>



<p>Red Cross offers help in Denmark and abroad when disasters strike and in refugee situations – in all kinds of crisis situations. They collect money to help, and it is a part of their digital presence to draw attention to eventual donations and current situations worldwide.

<p>They use Sleeknote when they want the user to focus on something specific and lead them to the right page on our site. It could be asking them to help, become volunteers and so on. They don’t use Sleeknote for its main purpose; email marketing, they aren’t generating any signups. They use it as an attention drawer. That means that if you are on an information page about a disaster, the SleekBox helps the user become aware of the opportunity to donate or contribute.</p>

<h2>Decreased Bounce Rate</h2>



<p>Sleeknote helps Red Cross solve a problem – the problem is, that people might read a text and then just move on. A SleekBox makes the user stop and read it, and it forces the reader to consider how to proceed. Since Red Cross started using Sleeknote, their bounce rate has decreased a lot, which is very positive – so say the least.</p>



<p>The other type of sleeknote they use at the moment is a sleeknote offering an email marketing course. They use this sleeknote on their blog. What they’ve done here, is that they describe what you’ll get when you sign up for their newsletter.</p>

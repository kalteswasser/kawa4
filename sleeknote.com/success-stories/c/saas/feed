<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>ProfitMetrics faced a lot of the same challenges as many other B2B businesses. They wanted to collect more leads—and convert those leads into customers—but didn’t have the time or resources to do so.</p>



<p>ProfitMetrics knew how important email marketing is, but lacked the time to properly map out email flows and figure out where to start. Frederik has been in the online industry for many years and was already collecting a lot of leads, but he wanted Sleeknote to give his lead generation a boost.&nbsp;</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f6350d419de8" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;The game-changer for me was the many years of experience Sleeknote has with popups, lead generation, and email marketing.&#8221;    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">
            <span class="customer-name">Frederik Boysen</span>
            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>For Frederik, it was important that he knew the people who would be doing the work for him. He had already seen the work of both Sleeknotes CMO, Emil Kristensen, and their Head of Email Marketing, Rikke Thomsen. He knew that they had the skills to implement a solid email marketing strategy, which was exactly what ProfitMetrics needed.</p>

<h2>The Collaboration</h2>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f63510c19de9" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;The whole process was very smooth and was customized to fit my schedule and my terms. I was briefed along the way on the progress, which gave me peace of mind to know that everything was taken care of.&#8221;

    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">
            <span class="customer-name">Frederik Boysen</span>
            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Whenever we needed Frederik to approve or give feedback on our initiatives, we just sent him an email or scheduled a quick call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frederik had some reservations about the price of our services to begin with but knew that the investment would pay off. In Frederik’s own words: </p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f6b33527eb4e" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;Sleeknote provides the skills and knowledge that I don’t have. A huge benefit for me is the many years of experience Sleeknote has with lead generation and email marketing.&#8221;

    </blockquote>
    <div class="customer">
        <div class="customer-image"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Frederik" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-150x150.png 150w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Frederik-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /> </div>        <div class="customer-meta" style="">
            <span class="customer-name">Frederik Boysen</span>
            <span class="customer-title">CEO of ProfitMetrics</span>        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Plus, ProfitMetrics is a SaaS company just like Sleeknote, which reassured Frederik that we could understand his business and its audience.</p>



<p>Frederik wanted to get a solid foundation for his email marketing, and most important of all, he wanted to automate the process to free up more time for him to do what he does best. With that in mind, we set up two automated email workflows for ProfitMetrics. One to welcome new subscribers and educate them about ROAS and ad spending, and one to help users get the most out of their free ProfitMetrics trial—and turn more free trials into paying customers.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>How ProfitMetrics Collects Valuable Feedback</h2>



<p>One of the first SleekBoxes we implemented on ProfitMetics.io was an Exit-Intent SleekBox that collects feedback from visitors leaving the site. The SleekBox asks why people visited the site, and what they expected ProfitMetrics might be able to help them with. This gives Frederik some good insights he can use to add small tweaks and optimize the site.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Design Process</h2>



<p>Having Sleeknote design the popups for him was also one of the reasons why Frederik chose Sleeknote.</p>


<div id="testimonial-block_5f63516c19deb" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        &#8220;I could easily pay a designer to design the popups for me, but that would be unnecessary money spent when Sleeknote knows what works and what doesn’t when it comes to popups.&#8221;    </blockquote>

<h2>Best Performing Campaign</h2>



<p>ProfitMetrics has a lot of success with its “Test din ROAS” campaign.</p>

<p>This SleekBox promotes a ROAS calculator and has a conversation rate of 4.86%. Frederik wanted to make it easy for site visitors to calculate their ROAS and see if their paid ads are generating actual profit. Once a visitor has calculated their ROAS, they get the results by email, giving Frederik and ProfitMetrics a really good sales lead. Frederik was also surprised to know that most of his visitors come from desktop because his understanding was that most customers start their journey on mobile.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>The Results</h2>



<p>Frederik also wanted to get more demo bookings. We implemented a demo booking popup on the site where visitors can book a demo with Frederik personally. The results so far have been very promising with a conversion rate of 10%.</p>



<p>They recently created an A/B test to see if a top bar&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;an eBook offer would outperform their slide-in&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;the eBook offer.</p>



<p>This is the top bar:</p>

<p>Knowing that you need to provide value to get people to sign up for a newsletter, Frederik came up with the idea of offering a valuable resource in exchange for an email address (the resource is called “How to increase your bottom line by 242% without increasing your marketing spend”). We set up a lead generation SleekBox with this offer, which as of writing, has a conversion rate of 3.25%.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>By implementing Sleeknote on their site, ProfitMetrics have been able to better understand what their customers want from their site. It has also given them the opportunity to engage with their customers and provide them with relevant content.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>Oberlo wanted to promote their valuable content to site visitors and collect relevant email leads. To do that, they needed a tool that offered full customization and advanced triggers that would enable them to target individual visitors with the right message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oberlo didn’t have these options with their previous popup tool, but once they tested Sleeknote, they knew they had found the right tool.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Turning Visitors into Quality Email Leads</h2>



<p>Oberlo provides access to a large number of eBooks, hubs, and online courses, and they wanted to use this content to build a relevant email list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One campaign offers a free eBook in exchange for an email address:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup features an illustration of the eBook, which makes it possible for visitors to visualize the value of what they’re getting.</p>



<p>This popup triggers after visitors have been on the site for 10 seconds or if a visitor is about to leave the site. This ensures a better user experience,&nbsp; as visitors get a chance to view the content of the page before getting the offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining a timed trigger with an exit-intent trigger, Oberlo ensures that every visitor gets a chance to download the eBook before they leave the site.</p>



<p>With this specific campaign, Oberlo collected more than 5,000 unique leads in just 6 days.</p>

    </div>
</div>


<p>Oberlo has also excluded existing subscribers from seeing this popup, as these people have already given their email address once.</p>



<p>Lastly, Oberlo has excluded this popup from showing on their other eBook pages where the call-to-action is different, making sure that it only appears when it’s relevant.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>From Visitor to Subscriber</h2>



<p>Oberlo also uses Sleeknote to collect newsletter permissions on their individual eBook pages:</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif" alt="Oberlo-Ebook" class="wp-image-95462" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-300x169.gif 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-768x432.gif 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-380x214.gif 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-600x338.gif 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-760x428.gif 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-62x35.gif 62w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-89x50.gif 89w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-740x416.gif 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-220x124.gif 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oberlo-Ebook-385x217.gif 385w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The popup is triggered with javascript, meaning it doesn’t show unless visitors click the “Download” button.</p>



<p>When visitors click the “Download” button, they don’t know they have to enter their name and email address. And yet, 96.92% of the visitors who did decided to follow-through and provide their details in exchange for the eBook.</p>



<p>That’s impressive, and it’s among the highest conversion rates we’ve ever seen for a campaign like this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails that Oberlo collects are segmented into different email lists based on what kind of eBook they have downloaded. By segmenting leads, Oberlo ensures that leads enter the most relevant email onboarding flow.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>A/B Testing to Find the Best Performing Popup</h2>



<p>To ensure that their campaigns are always optimized, Oberlo does a lot of A/B testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They recently created an A/B test to see if a top bar without an eBook offer would outperform their slide-in with the eBook offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the top bar:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="56" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-1024x56.png" alt="top bar" class="wp-image-95470" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-1024x56.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-300x17.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-768x42.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-380x21.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-600x33.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-760x42.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-180x10.png 180w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-250x14.png 250w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-740x41.png 740w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-220x12.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar-385x21.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/top-bar.png 1088w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And the slide-in:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="694" height="532" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png" alt="Sleekbox 1" class="wp-image-95466" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8.png 694w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-300x230.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-380x291.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-600x460.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-46x35.png 46w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-65x50.png 65w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-639x490.png 639w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-220x169.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sleekbox-1-8-385x295.png 385w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure></div>



<p>The results showed that the slide-in with the eBook offer performed 2000% better than the bar, underlining how important it is to offer an incentive in your popups.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Favorite Sleeknote Feature</h2>



<p>Siva’s favorite Sleeknote feature is the teaser.</p>



<p>The teaser is a small bar that shows at the bottom of the screen when your popup has yet to be triggered or after it’s been closed. On mobile, the teaser will show first and the popup will only trigger if a visitor clicks to learn more.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div id="testimonial-block_5ec272728bb75" class="block-testimonial">
    <blockquote class="quote">
        “I strongly believe that the teaser is one of the reasons we have such a high conversion rate on our campaigns. It’s a great way to tease the content of the popup in a non-intrusive way. It just works.”    </blockquote>

    </div>
</div>


<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Oberlo collects between 1,000-5,000 leads with each email popup they set live. They’ve understood how to combine intelligent triggers and conditions to target visitors at the right time with the right message and improve the customer journey.</p>



<p>In just one year, Oberlo has collected more than 39,500 leads for their email marketing.</p>

<h2>What Do They Use Sleeknote For?</h2>



<p>Campaign Monitor mainly uses Sleeknote to get people to sign up for their newsletter. At the moment they have 2 types of SleekBoxes active.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3>1. Guiding Visitors</h3>



<p>The first one is a SleekBox asking their visitors to subscribe to their newsletters. They have decided only to show this SleekBox on their “guides” page with the include/exclude feature that makes them able to choose what pages the SleekBox will be visible on.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="682" src="https://sleeknote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-1024x682.png" alt="campaign-monitor-guide" class="wp-image-94974" srcset="https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-1024x682.png 1024w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-300x200.png 300w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-768x511.png 768w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-380x253.png 380w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-600x399.png 600w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-760x506.png 760w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-53x35.png 53w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-75x50.png 75w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-736x490.png 736w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-220x146.png 220w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide-385x256.png 385w, https://n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/campaign-monitor-guide.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>When you click on one of the guides, a SleekBox shows up after 15 seconds. They use social proof in the SleekBox as they say “Join over 20,000 other marketers who get actionable tips on improving their email marketing delivered to their inbox”.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

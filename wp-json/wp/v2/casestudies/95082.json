An important step was ensuring the best possible user experience on their site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, this was done through user surveys, requiring preparation, countless interviews, and analyses. Like many in her position, Camilla did not have the time or resources to conduct these surveys, so she started looking for alternative solutions. \u201cI needed a simple yet reliable way to explore what our website visitors actually feel when they are about to finish their session,\u201d she told me. However, the challenge of conducting surveys on-site was doing it without hurting the overall user experience (UX).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Atea Gathers Feedback From its Visitors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Camilla explained that \u201cWhen you\u2019re working on your website for a long time, you sometimes go blind to obvious things users might be looking for, which can damage the overall UX and hurt your brand.\u201d To assess their visitors\u2019 experience, she introduced a simple form that asked them if they found what they were looking for. If they did not, they could then write down what they were after. What made this campaign special was using the exit-intent trigger, which \u201cdoes not interrupt the users and lets them go through a natural session,\u201d as Camilla explained it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"508\" height=\"366\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox1\" class=\"wp-image-95091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1.png 508w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-300x216.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-380x274.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-49x35.png 49w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-69x50.png 69w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-220x159.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1-385x277.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This ongoing campaign allows Camilla to tailor the user experience on Atea\u2019s website in a way that makes the most relevant content readily available. Patterns in the feedback show ways they can improve their online customer journey, at times by changing a simple call-to-action, other times by adjusting the information they display at the first glance. Furthermore, they can do all this in close to real time, which allows them to adapt to every small change in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting Leads<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Newsletter subscribers turned out to be great sales leads for Atea, which made acquiring them a priority. They approached lead generation in two main ways: (1) targeting special events and (2) offering relevant resources in return for newsletter permissions. Like many IT companies, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the most relevant events to Atea. To make the most of them, they used a two-step campaign. First, they signed visitors up to their newsletter two days before the event, by offering them access to the best Black Friday offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"323\" height=\"285\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox2\" class=\"wp-image-95095\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2.png 323w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2-300x265.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2-40x35.png 40w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2-57x50.png 57w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2-220x194.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>These campaigns ran for two days each and generated as many leads as the company usually gets over a two-week period. On the day of the event, they replaced the signup SleekBox with a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/guide-your-visitors\" target=\"_blank\">Guide Your Visitors<\/a> campaign, which took new visitors to the Black Friday deals page. Their 2017 Black Friday and Cyber Monday campaigns\u2019 revenue more than doubled compared to 2016, and according to Camilla \u201cUsing Sleeknote was definitely a big factor in this success.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380\" height=\"276\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox3-380x276\" class=\"wp-image-95099\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1-300x218.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1-48x35.png 48w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1-69x50.png 69w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1-220x160.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<div id=\"testimonial-block_5ec26be5636fa\" class=\"block-testimonial\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n        \u201cI don\u2019t think people outside our marketing team realize that this is an external tool and not actually a part of our CMS.

In her case, \u201cThe best thing about Sleeknote is its technical and visual flexibility.\u201d When she implemented Sleeknote, her first impression was that \u201cIt\u2019s just like everyone says\u2014easy to use, intuitive and flexible. But more than that, we didn\u2019t have to compromise on Atea\u2019s brand, as it blends in as an obvious part of the website.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Impact on Atea<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we are not at liberty to disclose Atea\u2019s specific numbers, Camilla told me that \u201cOur results are much better now, and the high conversion rates make Sleeknote very reliable.\u201d However, it is important to note that for their use case, specifically gathering user feedback, results go beyond sales and numbers. With this ongoing campaign, they are able to constantly take the pulse of their visitors and adapt their customer journey to the user\u2019s expectations in close to real-time. This surpasses even the traditional method of periodic surveys in both efficiency and effectiveness, allowing them to stay on top of developing market trends and changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different roles and responsibilities have their own unique challenges, and there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution. The creativity of the user needs to be complemented by the flexibility of their tools in order to overcome these challenges. Atea\u2019s use of Sleeknote is a perfect example a creative solution addressing an issue that has been plaguing many Digital Marketers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to define innovation: creating something completely new or combining existing tools and knowledge in a new way. This form of surveying visitors is the latter, trading the depth of traditional surveys for an effective and efficient solution that anyone could implement.<\/p>\n\n\n<div  class=\"grids-section grids-s-0d93278e-d26b-4b2f-9aa5-5a58d6b0e955 grids-is-stretch\"><div class=\"grids-s-w_i\">\n<div class=\"grids-area grids-a-5b00daaa-0da6-471b-b8b6-0e3b2d4f3b4d\"><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n<div  class=\"grids-section grids-s-18749f18-2eb9-45c9-b81f-0a10e0af603b grids-is-stretch alignfull\"><div class=\"grids-s-w_i\">\n<div class=\"grids-area grids-a-0b61a6bb-44e8-4858-997d-b100cea06045\">\n<div  class=\"grids-section grids-s-ff889b8c-9613-4fe4-a4de-e2126d4aac1d grids-is-stretch\"><div class=\"grids-s-w_i\">\n<div class=\"grids-area grids-a-ad15bff7-305e-416e-b83b-d842bd558013\"><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"grids-area grids-a-3ed1de38-f80b-4f41-ade9-1b1613a15891\">\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Want To Reach Your Visitors Before They Leave?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Watch the video below to learn how you can implement the exit intent trigger for your campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/embed\/iframe\/4scdrh0780?videoFoam=true\" title=\"How to Create An Exit-intent SleekBox for a Specific Landing page Video\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async><\/script>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"grids-area grids-a-29fa96b6-8398-4484-b478-dafc49bcb646\"><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-plum-color has-text-color\">ATEA\u2019S SLEEKBOXES<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"slideshow-block_5ec26c04636fb\" class=\"block-slideshow\">\n\n\n\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery\">\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox1.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox1\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox2.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox2\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Atea-SleekBox3-380x276-1.png\" alt=\"Atea-SleekBox3-380x276\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                            <div class=\"gallery-item\">\n                    <img src=\"\" data-flickity-lazyload-src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/sleekbox4-380x226-1.png\" alt=\"sleekbox4-380x226\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"gallery-item-caption\"><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n        <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls\">\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-no\">\n                <span class=\"gallery-index-current\"><\/span> of <span class=\"gallery-index-total\"><\/span>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"slideshow-gallery-controls-btns\">\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-prev\" role=\"navigation\">Previous<\/button><span><\/span><button type=\"button\" class=\"slideshow-next\" role=\"navigation\">Next<\/button>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    \n\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n","protected":false},"featured_media":95083,"parent":0,"template":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 -

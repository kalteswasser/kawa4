Their business works in three main directions: (1) Business-to-Business (B2B) sales of products to third-party retailers, (2) Business-to-Consumer (B2C) sales of products through their webshop, and (3) B2B sales of gift cards to retailers. All these sides of the business are interconnected, with B2B sales accounting for the larger part of the company\u2019s revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in order for retailers to be interested in selling their products, consumers need to know the brand and create demand for it. As such, generating brand awareness has always been a priority for the company, with the latest initiative for doing so being an Instagram campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Vinga of Sweden Chose Sleeknote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A stronger social media presence results in more brand awareness, which in turn generates more demand for Vinga of Sweden\u2019s products. Through a quantifiable metric, such as the number of social media followers, the company could more easily persuade retailers to offer their products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niklas Larsson, Vinga of Sweden\u2019s E-Commerce Manager, had a clear vision for how the campaign should work. He explained that \u201cWe wanted visitors to click on the message and follow our Instagram page. It was important that after they came back, we could show them another message, thanking them and displaying the discount code we promised.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niklas Larsson, Vinga of Sweden\u2019s E-Commerce Manager, had a clear vision for how the campaign should work.

To ensure all visitors saw this message without intruding on the user experience, Niklas cleverly combined the 10% scroll and exit intent triggers. As such, if the user was naturally browsing the page, the campaign would trigger once they scrolled down 10% of the page. However, if they wanted to leave before going down the 10%, the exit intent trigger took over and showed the campaign regardless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380\" height=\"461\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6.png\" alt=\"Sleekbox 1#\" class=\"wp-image-95137\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6-247x300.png 247w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6-29x35.png 29w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6-41x50.png 41w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sleekbox-1-6-220x267.png 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination proved extremely effective, as 20.1% of visitors clicked through this SleekBox.

Niklas explained that \u201cAlmost everybody goes through the website, so we can quickly send out messages through it.\u201d They do this for both urgent messages, such as technical issues the company is facing, or simply general updates relevant to visitors. The following is an example of a message displayed when the company\u2019s phone line was down:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"221\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem.png\" alt=\"Notification Of Technical Prolem\" class=\"wp-image-95133\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-300x111.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-380x140.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-95x35.png 95w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-136x50.png 136w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-220x81.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Notification-Of-Technical-Prolem-385x142.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these types of on-site messages, Vinga of Sweden established a new communication channel with their visitors and customers, enabling them to quickly broadcast short, but important messages. Before implementing Sleeknote, these messages were handled directly through their web platform, a process that Niklas told me \u201cinvolved a lot of steps just to add something simple to the site. With Sleeknote, we can change it quickly, straight from the editor.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:60px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As marketers, we tend to focus on tangible values. We convert, we sell, we measure. While these values are easy to quantify and make it easy to monitor our success, they tend to blind us to the importance of softer values. We tend to disregard social media followings as \u201cvanity metrics\u201d and choose to ignore their meaning, as they are hard to quantify. Any marketer would take 10 sales over 100 followers without blinking. But what if it\u2019s not so simple? What if, sometimes, we can be wrong?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vinga of Sweden\u2019s case is a perfect example of soft, \u201cvanity metrics\u201d having a strong, albeit indirect contribution to sales. As they primarily sell to other businesses, the value of these sales is beyond what any end user would purchase. From the outside, it might seem wasteful to aim for Instagram followers instead of newsletter subscribers, but in Vinga of Sweden\u2019s case, the demand they generated resulted in more sales than an email marketing list could have.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":95145,"parent":0,"template":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Vinga of Sweden Increased Brand Awareness | Sleeknote<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Read this Sleeknote Success Story to see how Vinga of Sweden leveraged their social media presence to increase their B2B sales.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How Vinga of Sweden Increased Brand Awareness | Sleeknote\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Read this Sleeknote Success Story to see how Vinga of Sweden leveraged their social media presence to increase their B2B sales.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sleeknote\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-10-22T07:25:12+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Vinga-Hero.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1440\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"450\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"3 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Sleeknote\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/full-logo-1.png\",\"width\":127,\"height\":35,\"caption\":\"Sleeknote\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/\",\"name\":\"Sleeknote\",\"description\":\"\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga#primaryimage\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Vinga-Hero.jpg\",\"width\":1440,\"height\":450,\"caption\":\"Vinga Hero\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga#webpage\",\"url\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga\",\"name\":\"How Vinga of Sweden Increased Brand Awareness | Sleeknote\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#website\"},\"primaryImageOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga#primaryimage\"},\"datePublished\":\"2020-05-06T12:38:49+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-10-22T07:25:12+00:00\",\"description\":\"Read this Sleeknote Success Story to see how Vinga of Sweden leveraged their social media presence to increase their B2B sales.\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/vinga\"]}]}]}<\/script>\n<!-- \/ Yoast SEO plugin. -->","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies\/95132"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/casestudies"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95145"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95132"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

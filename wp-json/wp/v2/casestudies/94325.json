In an effort to reduce confusion and improve the on-site user experience, If searched for a way to reach these visitors and help them find the solution best suited to their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The caveat was separating newcomers from those who already knew what they were looking for, as Mikkel Andreas Vig Hjarnaa, If\u2019s Web Analyst explained: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t trigger if they know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Thus, the aim was enhancing user experience wherever possible, without intruding on visitors who wouldn\u2019t derive value from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:80px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why If Chose Sleeknote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If already had a panel on their site that allowed customers to chat with their support and sales teams, but it wasn\u2019t trigger-based. As Mikkel put it \u201cWhenever you entered the shop, it was there, so it had a lot of limitations.\u201d He knew that targeting visitors at the right step of their journey was crucial to the user experience. Having heard of Sleeknote and its capabilities, If implemented it on their site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, they offered to help visitors via email, by subscribing them to their newsletter and guiding them to the right solutions. However, they quickly found that calling these users converted them to customers at a much higher rate. So they tweaked their campaigns and started asking for their phone numbers instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:80px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How If Used Sleeknote<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing their campaigns to the right visitors at the right time was a priority, as \u201cWe wanted to reach those who are in doubt or struggle with something, as they are most likely to leave,\u201d Mikkel told me. So they used manual triggers to target specific user behavior and interactions that indicated a visitor might have trouble finding what they were looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of this was their Auto Insurance page. Once a visitor clicked on it, they were asked for the license plate. If they didn\u2019t have one, they were taken to the Auto Insurance page like everyone else, while also triggering a relevant SleekBox that offered to help them find the right solution for their case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"390\" height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1.png\" alt=\"IfSleekBox1\" class=\"wp-image-94334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1.png 390w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-300x258.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-380x326.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-41x35.png 41w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-58x50.png 58w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-220x189.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox1-385x331.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a visitor had entered their phone number, the leads were transferred to If\u2019s call system, allowing for a seamless exchange between SleekBoxes and If\u2019s sales team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also used a six-second trigger for their product pages\u2019 campaigns. The difference between them was the copy, which If adapted to fit each page\u2019s topic. The example below is currently active on their \u201cAccident Insurance\u201d page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"310\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2.png\" alt=\"IfSleekBox2\" class=\"wp-image-94338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2.png 400w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-300x233.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-380x295.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-45x35.png 45w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-65x50.png 65w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-220x171.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/IfSleekBox2-385x298.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:80px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we can\u2019t disclose the specifics of If\u2019s results, they generated over 3,000 leads for their sales team in the form of phone numbers and had a good lead to customer conversion rate. Mikkel added that \u201cThe pattern we\u2019ve been seeing is that some of the customers don\u2019t buy anything on the spot, but many return and complete a purchase later on.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:80px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all users are created equal, so aiming for a consistent experience is paradoxical. A great experience for a knowledgeable user will vary widely from a great experience for a newcomer. Acknowledging differences in users and adapting to them is key to enhancing on-site interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\u2019s way of tweaking the online customer journey for newcomers is a great example of personalizing the experience to the user\u2019s needs. Offering to help all visitors find the right solution is one thing, but offering to help struggling visitors find the right solution is something else entirely.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":94326,"parent":0,"template":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How If Used &quot;Connect With Visitors&quot; to Generate Sales Leads | Sleeknote<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Read this Success Story to find out how If used manual triggers and &quot;Connect With Visitors&quot; to generate more leads for their sales team.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How If Used &quot;Connect With Visitors&quot; to Generate Sales Leads | Sleeknote\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Read this Success Story to find out how If used manual triggers and &quot;Connect With Visitors&quot; to generate more leads for their sales team.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sleeknote\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-10-22T07:20:59+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/if-hero.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"2042\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1154\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Sleeknote\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/full-logo-1.png\",\"width\":127,\"height\":35,\"caption\":\"Sleeknote\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/\",\"name\":\"Sleeknote\",\"description\":\"\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if#primaryimage\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/if-hero.jpg\",\"width\":2042,\"height\":1154,\"caption\":\"if hero\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if#webpage\",\"url\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if\",\"name\":\"How If Used \\\"Connect With Visitors\\\" to Generate Sales Leads | Sleeknote\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/#website\"},\"primaryImageOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if#primaryimage\"},\"datePublished\":\"2020-05-05T08:06:27+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-10-22T07:20:59+00:00\",\"description\":\"Read this Success Story to find out how If used manual triggers and \\\"Connect With Visitors\\\" to generate more leads for their sales team.\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"http:\/\/sleeknote.com\/success-stories\/if\"]}]}]}<\/script>\n<!-- \/ Yoast SEO plugin. -->","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies\/94325"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/casestudies"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94326"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94325"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

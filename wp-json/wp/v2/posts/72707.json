wasn\u2019t enough to optimize small things like <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/email-copywriting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">email copy<\/a>. We needed to revise our entire strategy and find a way to give value to our audience while still selling our product.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem wasn\u2019t our emails on their own, but rather who we were sending them to and why.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our emails were engaging a small segment of our audience, but not our entire list of subscribers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because not all email subscribers are created equal.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important part of our new strategy was using <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/email-list-segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">email segmentation<\/a> (I\u2019ll expand on this later), and we ended up with four different automated email onboarding workflows for four different subscriber segments:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Subscribers in the e-commerce industry<\/li><li>Subscribers in the SaaS industry<\/li><li>Subscribers who are beginners to online marketing<\/li><li>Subscribers who work for an agency<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We found these segments by <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/buyer-personas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">researching our audience<\/a> and existing customers to get an overview of not only who we wanted to target with our emails, but also who were signing up and why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how each of those four onboarding email sequences perform today.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>E-commerce segment:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

No Consideration of The Buyer\u2019s Journey<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses don\u2019t consider where their prospects are in <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/the-buyers-journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">the buyer\u2019s journey<\/a> when sending promotional emails.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, a beginner to online marketing might not be ready to buy a subscription for a complicated SEO tool just because they signed up for the newsletter. Most likely, they signed up to learn more about online marketing, and are unlikely to respond to promotional emails.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if a prospect opted in for a best practice guide for your product, they\u2019re likely much further along their journey and might be considering a purchase.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always consider where your subscribers sign up, and where that puts them in their customer journey.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also score prospects based on their level of engagement (lead scoring), so prospects with high scores are, in theory, more likely to buy than those with low scores.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Too Much Generic Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generic emails are typically emails that are sent to a large audience with little or no segmentation.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketers tend to use generic content because it requires less work, and appeals to a larger audience. But in doing so, their conversion rates decrease because only a fraction of the audience will find the emails highly relevant.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers today want personalization, and generic emails don\u2019t give them that.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expert <a href=\"https:\/\/rightmessage.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brennan Dunn<\/a> says:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><span class=\"has-inline-color has-plum-color\">\u201cIf you&#8217;re speaking to everyone, you&#8217;re speaking to no one.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. A Large Focus on Features<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I keep seeing in onboarding emails is a large focus on features.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails containing a lot of information about all the features a product has, how to use them, and how great they are.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s missing is,\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the value that your features will provide? How will they make your prospect\u2019s life easier?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sprout Social<\/a>:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"322\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-322x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Sprout Social Email Onboarding\" class=\"wp-image-72796\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-322x1024.jpg 322w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-94x300.jpg 94w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-380x1208.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-11x35.jpg 11w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-16x50.jpg 16w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-154x490.jpg 154w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-220x700.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding-385x1224.jpg 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Sprout-Social-Email-Onboarding.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:36px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>They tell their audience what the benefits of their tools are and how to use them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even though they include \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d, in their email it still has a very high focus on features.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of focusing so much on the features of your product, you should focus on providing value to your audience and establish yourself as an authority within your area of expertise.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your prospects view you as an authority, they\u2019ll automatically be more inclined to purchase any products you pitch to them regardless of how many features it has.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>iv. Lack of Personalization<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/t20161011T222718Z__w__\/us-en\/_acnmedia\/PDF-34\/Accenture-Pulse-Check-Dive-Key-Findings-Personalized-Experiences.pdfla=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Seventy-five percent of consumers<\/a> are more likely to buy from a retailer that recognizes them by name, recommends options based on past purchases, and knows their purchase history.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your marketing efforts to pay off, personalization is key (especially with onboarding).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, few marketers understand the concept of personalization and how it\u2019s done right.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many think it\u2019s enough to include the recipient\u2019s name in the email or the <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/email-subject-lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">subject line<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization is about sending <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/buyer-personas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">the right emails, at the right time, to the right person<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you have to segment your audience and send trigger based emails depending on what, how, and when prospects have engaged with your content, product, or emails.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, I booked a trip to Costa Rica with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gadventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">G Adventures<\/a>, and a week before my trip, they sent this email:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even though this email is automated it feels personal because it\u2019s relevant and was sent at just the right time to the right person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How We Drove More Engagement with Our Emails (and How You Can Too)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know what <em>not<\/em> to do when onboarding new subscribers, we can dive into the actual process of creating an email flow that encourages engagement.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, I\u2019ll take you through the exact process we went through to optimize our onboarding here at Sleeknote, and how you can do the same.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these three steps to increase your email engagement.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Define Your Audience Segments<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can create relevant emails, you need to define your audience segments\u2014also known as your <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/buyer-personas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">buyer personas<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These will have a massive influence on your onboarding approach.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching our audience and our customers, we found four overall buyer personas which were: e-commerce businesses, SaaS businesses, Beginners to online marketing, and Agencies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of segmenting your target audience is to get an understanding of the different types of potential customers you have, so you can create an onboarding sequence specifically tailored to the individual.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Get Your Subscribers to Segment Themselves<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After defining our buyer personas, we needed a way to get our subscribers to segment themselves into our new segments.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people don\u2019t segment themselves, we have no way of knowing what type of emails to send them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you get people to do that?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You simply ask nicely.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sleeknote, we have two ways of asking our subscribers to segment themselves:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. In our welcome email workflow<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ii. At the point of signup<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how we do that with each one.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>i.

\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are advantages and disadvantages for segmenting at the point of signup.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage is that you get ALL subscribers segmented and no one is left in \u201cno man\u2019s land.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, asking for this information when people sign up, will also decrease your conversion rate because it takes longer to fill in, and there\u2019s also the question of privacy and how much information people are willing to share with you at this point.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a fine balance, and we\u2019ve found that what works best for us, is to only ask for a segmentation at the point of signup on the landing pages where we offer a lead magnet like the above.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that the conversion rate for this page is lower than on the pages where we don\u2019t ask readers to segment themselves, but the leads we get from our lead magnet landing pages are in much warmer than those who \u201cjust\u201d sign up for our newsletter.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve tested many different versions of this (with or without segmentation, CTA buttons, copy, design, and much more), and I recommend you do the same to figure out what works best for you and your audience.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Create Relevant Emails and Convert Subscribers Into Customers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s finally time to start sending the right emails, to the right people, at the right time\u2014and trust me, it will do wonders for your email engagement.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we developed a strategy for how we would onboard each of these segments and make the transition from a subscriber to a customer as natural as possible.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that getting subscribers to buy our product is much harder than getting them started on a free trial.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know the value of our product, but our subscribers may not, which is why we want them to start a free trial so they can see if Sleeknote is the right tool for them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that Sleeknote isn\u2019t for everyone, but you won\u2019t know until you try,

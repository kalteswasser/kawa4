But that\u2019s okay.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn B2B, we don\u2019t need to know their shoe size and we don\u2019t need to talk about their gender,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/getsocialmediatips.com\/a-small-amount-of-data-can-do-it-for-b2b-personalization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ardath Ablee<\/a>, CEO of Marketing Interactions. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to know they live in the suburbs and have a wife, two kids, and a dog, and they drive a red Corvette.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, a small amount of data along with a few key insights relating to the prospect\u2019s industry will suffice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on that note, here are some specific B2B personalization strategies that don\u2019t require a ton of data, along with real-life examples you can get inspiration from.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>Personalize Your Signup Forms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably don\u2019t need to tell you that email is still one of the best mediums for <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/b2b-lead-generation-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nurturing leads<\/a>. But it also happens to be one of the best for providing an ultra-personalized experience. And it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great strategy for getting started is to create personalized signup forms for demos, eBooks, whitepapers, and so on, where you ask leads for key information so you can customize your interactions accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from inbound lead conversion and scheduling app, Chili Piper. On their demo booking page, they ask leads to enter their work email address, which is a given.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But besides that, they also ask leads to enter the CRM they\u2019re using and the country\/region they\u2019re located in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/ygZEH_GI9jgtRBY8MGrvMqL9YieH-AhDGbAIh86IBQx01nnaErk3FjkpBQHhzT8wvhin9cuujtJq6fv-n0A7zUL_IEdGd3BFsGt0Itmh4dOlISqWKEoydNGgxekOmmBpS7RMsFwy\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, for instance, a prospect said that they used Salesforce and were located in Denmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/ze5uYIGB-ua31D8QDuiMxVWeJKj2CbNqY06OGNTS0Z0EKsufd5g6YwXpUfN5CWiabFDxHvpYmTdDzNZiU-WignOCVgxLhcHywKLoA-k_OKYCtpgGT1P1l-64Rwh-KYeAom-g6WeM\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chili Piper could then use that information for two primary purposes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, they could pass it on to their sales reps so they could fine-tune their demo to discuss Chili Piper and Salesforce integrations, along with location-specific offers for users in Europe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And two, they could send personalized emails that zero in on B2Bs that use Salesforce\u2014maybe how a scheduling app can help Salesforce users book meetings more efficiently, for example.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Chili Piper didn\u2019t grab a ton of detailed information, they can still use it to get the conversation started out on the right foot and personalize their interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, this lets leads know that Chili Piper doesn\u2019t view them as \u201cjust a number\u201d but as an individual with unique needs. The last thing I need to point out is that generally speaking, there\u2019s a correlation between more form fields and fewer signups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ventureharbour.com\/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Here\u2019s data<\/a> from one of the most classic studies on this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/_SQpXl7S8uv00W_M-2Dx5Km8p9M4ZTRWB5qEc9nNQYxrWH2YT9haKCuLjVO9t1YSDNptZ3qxZNYHADtWPL31ezjugiD3s-cYC3q2U0BevkPGV9YDj140on5jG2RKy5ODUg9OxEvF\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you need to be cognizant of how many fields you include and not ask for extraneous information that isn\u2019t truly necessary. The trick is to find the sweet spot where your signup form gives you enough data to go on without sabotaging your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once you find that, your B2B personalization should be ready to rock and roll.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>Suggest Related Content&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainsalestraining.com\/blog\/how-many-touches-does-it-take-to-make-a-sale#:~:text=The%20simple%20answer%20is%3A%20more,conversion)%20with%20a%20new%20prospect.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eight touchpoints<\/a> to get an initial meeting or conversion with a prospect. That\u2019s a lot. One of the best ways to create more touches and familiarize leads with your brand is to encourage them to check out more of your content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does this give you the opportunity to build rapport and get them comfortable with your brand, but it\u2019s also perfect for showcasing your knowledge and expertise. Besides that, it also presents an opportunity for personalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, for example, a B2B prospect stumbled upon one of your blog posts through search engine results. If they only read that single article, they may get some helpful information, but unless they were completely wowed, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019d leave and never return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, however, they\u2019re directed to additional posts on your blog, they\u2019d get even more helpful content and become more acclimated to your brand. Suggesting related content is dead simple but can be just the ticket for creating a more personalized experience, while at the same time adding more touchpoints that inevitably lead up to a conversion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HubSpot is the master of this technique. Here\u2019s one of their articles on how marketers can use social media to meet business objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/IuVrrnPbtMwFWuE6HdF1m4qxmejzXykdbVyMlVdKl_LSiHsXLDR3WXVz2xiBT9pt4A4wlAfG_DyvZEHWJkmQ4H2pCXulYDBDepyd6sl7PFdbKrCFkw_-PL-_CVjy3kMW31yrpg5N\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good read and provides plenty of meaty information that translates into actionable advice.

Although it may not seem like that big of a deal, the impact can be huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, one study found that the click-through rate of an email sent from a company was only 0.73%, while an <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/6-email-personalization-techniques\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">email sent from an account manager was 0.96%<\/a>, which translated into 292 more clicks. And that\u2019s just one email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about what the results would be like if you did this consistently. That\u2019s why this strategy is definitely worth experimenting with. Just make sure that the account manager you assign is able to promptly respond to the replies you get from leads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>Send Existing Customers Personalized Reports<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategies I\u2019ve covered up until now have all been aimed at getting leads to convert. But what about your existing customers?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.revechat.com\/blog\/reduce-customer-churn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Research has found<\/a> that creating more personalized interactions with them helps improve their overall experience and lowers churn. One of the best ways to go about this is to send out personalized reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for instance, this one from <a href=\"https:\/\/help.rescuetime.com\/article\/36-personal-productivity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">automatic time-tracking software, RescueTime<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/igwspJbK02kFdt8Rnleqk4CuMWta8qaIgcpeLGpxsRayVca3bQ0Hg00_0eux2zem5m_GPb39gsilM3xR3zsTZBHrjuTvqcUOopzUwokS5gDNrTuNKZxpPvfmS19K912McKIVIXZd\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of their product is to help businesses effectively manage their time and minimize productivity leaks. So, they send out a weekly email summary that outlines how each user\u2019s time was spent the previous week.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way they can stay on top of productivity trends without having to manually check their reports, which helps save time. And just look at how incredibly personalized it is. RescueTime tailors every report to each individual user, letting them know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How many hours they logged<\/li><li>What their productivity score was<\/li><li>What their most productive day was<\/li><li>What their most productive time was<\/li><li>What activities their time went toward<\/li><li>The top apps and websites they used<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They even break everything down into detailed data, using hours and percentages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this specific type of report won\u2019t be applicable to every B2B company, it\u2019s certainly a model that you should be able to incorporate in some form.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s just a matter of finding useful information your customers will be interested in and that will help them get the most of your product. Then, condense that into a personalized report and send it through <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/b2b-email-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email<\/a> for maximum convenience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e6b6231abd15\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\">FREE DOWNLOADABLE BONUS<\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 12 CRO resources to help you drive more leads and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for satisfaction guarantee examples or product page examples, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 23+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, B2B personalization is a bit trickier than B2C personalization\u2014something that\u2019s largely due to the fact that it\u2019s harder for B2B companies to collect meaningful data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it\u2019s still a tactic that can be done effectively. And as we just learned, there are several techniques that can be used to create a more personalized experience, both for leads you\u2019re trying to convert as well as for existing customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalizing signup forms and suggesting relevant content are great ways to start. And once you\u2019ve collected a person\u2019s email, addressing your messages from an official account manager and providing personalized reports can take things to the next level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How important do you think B2B personalization currently is?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everything You Need to Know About B2B Personalization Conversion Rate Optimization You get the idea.

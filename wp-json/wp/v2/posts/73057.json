Why is it now telling me not to?\u201d, but what this really means is that you shouldn\u2019t become too sales-y with millennials \u2013 it makes them turn their heads away.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days when a simple \u201cBuy Now!\u201d sales pitch worked for the market. They\u2019ve grown up with those types of ad continually bombarded in their senses, and they\u2019re tired of it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t sell to them outright. You need to convince them why, in a way that benefits them greatly, and without looking like they were talking to a car salesman who\u2019s constantly talking about how they should buy a car in that moment or watching a blatant product placement from their favorite series.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your products are screaming for obvious sales attention, you\u2019re bound to attract only deaf ears.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Etude House Global\u2019s posts attempt to sell to their target market (primarily millennial females who are Korean makeup and skincare enthusiasts) by providing them with the benefits and use of their products in their social media posts.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cAny Cushion Color Corrector\u201d and \u201cPlay 101 Stick Color Contour Duo\u201d post presents these products with both aesthetic appeal and benefit-laden information.

Match How Millennials Communicate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Skip the TV and radio \u2013 millennials hardly pay attention or even use those anymore. They\u2019re more than likely tuned into their <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/mobile-email-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">phones<\/a> or devices, browsing the Internet for hours on end, and that\u2019s your best avenue for reaching them. After all, millennials grew up in the age of websites and social networking \u2013 from MySpace and AOL to <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/facebook-lead-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Facebook<\/a>, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, online shops, etc.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When communicating with other people, <a href=\"http:\/\/genhq.com\/marketing-selling-to-millennials-gen-y\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Center for Generational Kinetics<\/a> found that millennials prefer these methods (in order of importance):<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Text and IM apps, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger;<\/li><li>Email, with the subject line being a highly important aspect;<\/li><li>Social media;<\/li><li>Phone calls; and<\/li><li>In person<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These methods should be kept in mind when directly communicating with your millennial market, especially when it comes to them seeking customer support.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that it\u2019s best to keep multiple ways of contacting your business as well \u2013 not all customers use a single way and some might prefer one method over the other, even if it is the less popular or less-used one. There are different benefits per method of communication that will try to take advantage of in specific circumstances.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For general lines of questions or quick inquiries, keep your WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook Messenger lines open. You can also utilize social media for this, as well as the private message options that can be found on various platforms such as Instagram and Twitter.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails and phone calls are reserved for more lengthy transactions, business-related matters, longer inquiries (such as reporting or detailing problems) or those concerning personal information.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-person inquiries are mostly used as a last resort by millennials, and would most likely apply to those who are in the vicinity to make the effort.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1.jpg\" alt=\"whatsapp-1\" class=\"wp-image-73098\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-380x285.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-47x35.jpg 47w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-67x50.jpg 67w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-220x165.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/whatsapp-1-385x289.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Be Informative, but Be Quick<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Millennials are curious, yes, but they are also quite busy and always shifting from one activity to another. Holding them longer than they want to will bore them and will render your sales pitch unimportant for them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say, however, that they are attention-deficit \u2013 after all, this is the generation that will binge-watch multiple seasons of The Walking Dead in a few days\u2019 time, which means they\u2019ll only pay attention to what they want to, in the right medium.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019ll also fact-check what you\u2019re offering them regardless of what you tell them, so it\u2019s almost a wasted effort trying to explain everything rather than letting them have the natural curiosity to explore. Your goal is to convince them why they need your product in the least amount of time it takes, but leave out the heavier, more detailed information so you don\u2019t waste your time, and theirs.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strike the balance between telling them what they want or need to know and keeping your speech short. The most important benefit or factor they can derive from your product or service is often a great point to start with, along with one or two supplementary benefits. Don\u2019t go into a whole spiel about your product unless you\u2019re sure they\u2019re more than ready to listen until the end.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this ad by AirBNB gives one important benefit for their services: the sense of belongingness anywhere around the world. Travelers, especially the millennials, want to feel comfortable and at ease with the surroundings they are in, especially in foreign places, which AirBNB promises they will get.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, they already captured attention within the combination of a phrase and a supplementary sentence, and would only detail more about what they are offering if the audience clicks the button \u2013 which ensures them that whoever is reading is interested in learning more.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB.jpg\" alt=\"AirBnB\" class=\"wp-image-73058\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-300x162.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-380x205.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-65x35.jpg 65w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-93x50.jpg 93w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-220x119.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/AirBnB-385x208.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. Don\u2019t Try to Dupe Them<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, millennials have a great tendency to fact-check, whether you want them to or not. They\u2019ll scour the Internet to learn more about what you are trying to sell to them so they aren\u2019t caught in any surprises that they might not like \u2013 and if they are, millennials are more than willing to spread the word about it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a millennial checking out an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com.ph\/sell\/clothes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">online clothing business<\/a> would refer to the comments, reviews, and even ask their peers before they make any transactions or purchases.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t try too hard to relate to them \u2013 they can figure it out. Millennials want <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/how-to-sell-to-millennials?__hstc=200701681.b9f8a6c7ed174538b66e871d068efce2.1571665693017.1581416034103.1581421030689.306&amp;__hssc=200701681.79.1581421030689&amp;__hsfp=1744152835#sm.0000sozzdhi17fl0zwn18s21tvx13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">real, down-to-earth people<\/a> who can truly connect with them and give them the truth.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, they want authenticity to counteract their skepticism. Be consistent and transparent with whatever you tell them about your goods or services, and if their fact-checking reveals that you were right, they will be more eager to listen the next time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starbucks is a good example of this. When inquired, they are willing to educate their audience on the composition of their drinks to answer their questions \u2013 which is useful not only to the person who asked but to anyone who reads about the information the next time they might order something similar.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"744\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1.jpg\" alt=\"starbucks-1\" class=\"wp-image-73094\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-242x300.jpg 242w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-380x471.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-28x35.jpg 28w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-40x50.jpg 40w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-395x490.jpg 395w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-220x273.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/starbucks-1-385x477.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. Appeal to Their Emotions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been observing things that millennials have trended over the years in social media, you\u2019ll see how many of these are because millennials felt strongly about them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things are a big deal for millennials \u2013 from companies launching environmentally-affective projects, to social issues that they feel will affect their futures. Some are even designed just to let them have a good time or feel good. Either way, their emotions are one of the ruling factors for their engagement tendencies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make them laugh, make them cry, give them something that will have an impact on their beliefs and their world.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example is Dove\u2019s \u201cChoose Beauty\u201d campaign \u2013 the video of the campaign became a viral hit after people are left with different emotions while watching women make a choice. People left and right are sharing to express their opinions on the impact and significance of the campaign on women empowerment.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1.jpg\" alt=\"Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1\" class=\"wp-image-73070\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-380x213.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-62x35.jpg 62w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-89x50.jpg 89w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-220x124.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Dove-Choose-Beautiful-Campaign-1-385x216.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of thinking of ways how your brand can come up with some convoluted advocacy that will sound and feel dubious (see point 4), think of an advocacy that you can see your company doing that matters to millennials, and just subtly let them know that you can help them fight for their cause.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If advocacies are not doable for you, just take the backseat. Joke around with your millennial market. Make memes. Give them stories that will touch their hearts.

Act like a Counselor<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressing millennials requires you to act as the guiding point in regards to both your business and how it relates to their lives. They want to know that you can hear them, you can acknowledge their problems, and solve it for them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acting like an expert who has the solutions to their problems will let you develop a relationship with them, and ultimately makes you a trustworthy business in their judgment.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research what kinds of problems you can address firsthand, then create content about it. Always be ready to answer when they are asking you. Open their eyes to problems they never knew they had and present your solution afterward.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These methods allow you to establish yourself as a person they can approach when they are confused and will let them remember you more.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many makeup companies, such as Maybelline, create content based around helping their niche with makeup-related problems \u2013 this one about contouring based on face shape being a prime example. This can be used to your leverage as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"606\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1.jpg\" alt=\"maybelline-1\" class=\"wp-image-73078\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-297x300.jpg 297w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-380x384.jpg 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-35x35.jpg 35w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-485x490.jpg 485w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-220x222.jpg 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-385x389.jpg 385w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/maybelline-1-120x120.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A page dedicated to selling clothes online can enumerate tips on what clothes to pair with each other, or how certain articles of clothing can be styled various ways for different occasions.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can help you both provide expert advice to your millennial audience and sell to them \u2013 after all, you\u2019ve shown how your products can be used and how effective your methods are, which is what we pointed out at the first tip.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7.

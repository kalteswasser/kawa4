Choose the Survey Type That Best Fits Your Needs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>E-commerce surveys are like a bag of Matador Mix\u2014they come in many flavors. Those flavors include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/customer-satisfaction-surveys#leverage-an-nps-survey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Net Promoter Score<\/strong><\/a><strong> (NPS):<\/strong> Customers are asked a single, simple question\u2014\u201cHow likely are you to recommend our business to a friend or colleague?\u201d\u2014and asked to give a score from 1 to 10.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):<\/strong> Designed to assess a customer\u2019s feeling toward a specific event. Customers are asked to answer, in the form of a rating from 1 to 5, a question like: \u201cHow would you rate the quality of your most recent service interaction?\u201d&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Customer Effort Score (CES): <\/strong>Used to measure how easy (or hard) it was for the customer to complete a specific action. The classic CES question reads: \u201cOn a scale of \u2018very easy\u2019 to \u2018very difficult\u2019, how easy was it to interact with <em>Company X<\/em>?\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the quantitative<em> <\/em>data-gathering described above, each survey type can also include a qualitative<em> <\/em>element in which respondents are asked to explain their initial rating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each survey type has its strengths and weaknesses, and the right choice for you will depend on the purpose of your survey:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>NPS: <\/strong>These quick-and-easy surveys tend to generate high response rates and, because they\u2019re quite general, can be used at any point in the customer lifecycle. The results are most meaningful when NPS surveys are sent regularly over an extended period.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>CSAT: <\/strong>If you\u2019re looking to measure the performance of your customer service function, a CSAT survey is the one for you.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>CES: <\/strong>Looking to identify speed bumps in your path to purchase and smooth out your user journey? A CES survey is your best bet.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could build a custom e-commerce survey using a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SurveyMonkey<\/a>, where you can ask whatever you want\u2014but you\u2019ll need to do all the legwork yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2\"><strong>2. Get Your Timing Right<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Timing is everything with a survey. To get the most insightful results, you need to identify the actions that make a customer a good candidate for your survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I\u2019ve not interacted with your brand for six months, it\u2019d be a weird time to ask my thoughts on your user experience. But it could be a good time to dig into why<em> <\/em>I\u2019ve not purchased from you recently (particularly if I\u2019ve previously been a regular customer).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, those key actions will vary based on the purpose of your survey, but common touchpoints include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>After a customer returns an item they\u2019ve purchased;<\/li><li>After a customer takes delivery of a new product;<\/li><li>After a returning shopper <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/cart-abandonment-popup-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abandons their basket<\/a>;<\/li><li>After a support agent resolves a customer query; and<\/li><li>After a customer downloads your app.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Start Big-Picture, Then Get Granular<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you\u2019ve visited a friend\u2019s house for dinner. They want to know if you\u2019re enjoying yourself, so they ask a bunch of questions: \u201cHow\u2019s the lighting? Do you like the wine? Is your seat comfortable? Have you eaten enough? How\u2019s the temperature? Is the music too quiet?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, at the end of the night, they ask: \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By that point, they\u2019ve already forced you to scrutinize every tiny aspect of the evening, including a bunch of things you might never have considered if they hadn\u2019t asked. That\u2019s definitely going to have an impact\u2014probably a negative one\u2014on your overall verdict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you should always start out by asking customers your broadest and most important question, such as how likely they are to recommend your brand, or whether they found you <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-conversion-rate-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">easy to buy from<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve asked that big-picture question, dig down into the specifics to provide context for their initial response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\"><strong>4. Make a Habit of Sending Regular Surveys<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t treat e-commerce surveys as a one-and-done activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, a single survey will provide you with a snapshot of how happy your customers are at a specific point. But <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/e-commerce-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">e-commerce<\/a> is a fast-moving industry, and that information won\u2019t mean much three months down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, send surveys regularly. NPS is only an effective metric if you survey every customer\u2014or at least, a decent chunk of your customers\u2014after they make a purchase. Done regularly, it allows you to track satisfaction over time. Done once, it doesn\u2019t tell you much at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other benefits to regular e-commerce surveys, too. For one thing, they demonstrate to customers that you\u2019re genuinely invested in improving their experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for another, they let you chart how your actions have influenced customer happiness. If your NPS increases after you switch to a new delivery partner or <a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/best-e-commerce-website-builders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build a new website<\/a>, that\u2019s a good sign your efforts are paying off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\"><strong>5. Cut Out Unnecessary Noise<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the more questions you include in a survey, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.co.uk\/mp\/tips-increasing-survey-completion-rates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the fewer responses you\u2019ll get<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"651\" height=\"376\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-118524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10.png 651w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-300x173.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-380x219.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-600x347.png 600w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-61x35.png 61w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-87x50.png 87w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-220x127.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-10-385x222.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here? Don\u2019t get greedy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sound like an obvious point, but it\u2019s too easy to include questions that you\u2019d like, but don\u2019t need, to know the answer to. Those questions are unnecessarily elongating your survey, which means you\u2019ll end up with less data overall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really need to know how a respondent first heard about your brand? Will it tell you anything you can\u2019t find out in five seconds on Google Analytics? If you don\u2019t have a watertight reason for including a question, shelve it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6\"><strong>6. Keep It Short<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, survey abandonment isn\u2019t solely about how many questions you ask\u2014it\u2019s also about the complexity of those questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same SurveyMonkey study I referenced in the previous section gives us some valuable insight on this. Specifically, it tells us there\u2019s a 10 percent point drop in completion rates between surveys with one open-ended question and surveys with 10 such questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"598\" height=\"389\" src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-118526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11.png 598w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-300x195.png 300w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-400x260.png 400w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-380x247.png 380w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-54x35.png 54w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-77x50.png 77w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-220x143.png 220w, https:\/\/n7nqziuw1z4b1r6k2adhav10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image2-11-385x250.png 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because open-ended, free-form questions are harder to answer. It\u2019s not a case of choosing a number from 1 to 5; you have to think\u2014and type\u2014your response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how long should your study take to complete?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2501\/IJMR-2017-039?journalCode=mrea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">International Journal of Market Research<\/a>, the ideal survey takes 10 minutes to finish, and the maximum length should be 20 minutes. Any longer than that and you\u2019ll see a big spike in abandon rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\"><strong>7. Only Offer a Small Range of Ratings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think a wide rating system is more desirable because it lets your customers give more nuanced responses. But in reality, it could be making your survey harder to complete and ruining your data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it. Say I\u2019ve asked you to rate this blog post on a scale of 1-3. Easy, right? If you hate it, you\u2019ll score it one. If you love it, I get a three. If you like some parts but hate others, call it a two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if I asked you to rate it out of 10? If you have extreme feelings toward my writing, that\u2019s fine. But how do you choose between a seven or eight? What\u2019s a six?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And more to the point, if I asked 10 other people to do the same thing, how can I be sure they all assigned the same meaning to their scores?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the picture. Sure, a broad scale might sound more meaningful, but in reality, it can be exactly the opposite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8\"><strong>8. Send a Test Survey Before the Real One<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any data-gathering exercise, it\u2019s best to sense-check your survey before rolling it out at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, send it to a select group of customers first and see what comes back. Also, add a few questions about the experience of filling out the survey, or send them as a separate mini-survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach will help you assess:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Completion rates: <\/strong>Are you getting enough responses? If not, you may be asking too many open-ended questions, or simply too many questions altogether.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Data quality: <\/strong>Do the results give you the insights you need? Or is your data too broad or too specific?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Data type: <\/strong>Are you acquiring enough qualitative data to add meaning to all the numbers?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to do this multiple times before you send the first \u201creal\u201d survey to all<em> <\/em>your customers. These surveys will play a key role in informing future customer experience decisions, so you need to be completely satisfied with the quality of the data you\u2019re seeing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"9\"><strong>9. Steer Clear of Loaded Questions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As humans, we naturally want to be loved. We also want things to appear better than they really are. Those two factors can be a major barrier to creating effective and meaningful e-commerce surveys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want people to like your brand, so you ask them a question that inadvertently (or deliberately) skews their opinion in your favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you were personally involved in rolling out a new feature or product, so you highlight how great it is, again influencing the customer\u2019s response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading questions might help you gain higher survey scores. But those scores won\u2019t be valuable, because they won\u2019t accurately reflect how your customers feel about you. That could lead you to make poor decisions based on bad numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these deadly leading questions look like? Here\u2019s a great example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.co.uk\/curiosity\/how-to-avoid-asking-leading-and-loaded-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SurveyMonkey<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Leading question: <\/strong>\u201cOur customer support team is rated as being the most responsive in the industry. How responsive\u2014or unresponsive\u2014do you think they are?\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Neutral question: <\/strong>\u201cWhat do you think of our customer support team?\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to ask the first question. But if your support team is really<em> <\/em>that good, you need to trust that your customers will recognize this and score them accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"contentupgrade-block_5e9ff85a7a3a4\" class=\"block-content-upgrade\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n        <p class=\"text-pretitle\"><\/p>\n        <h2 class=\"text-title\">Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?<\/h2>\n        <div class=\"text-content\"><p>We\u2019ve put together 12 CRO resources to help you drive more leads and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for satisfaction guarantee examples or product page examples, we\u2019ve got something for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get immediate access to 23+ other bonus resources, categorized in Notion for your convenience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n                    <a onClick=\"SleekNote.triggerOnclick('00c91b9b-1dbc-48da-8d77-1dd2cfc8355b');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"text-link\" title=\"Download Swipe File Now \u2192\">Download Swipe File Now \u2192<\/a>\n            <\/div>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Grow-Your-Email-List@2x-1.png\" title=\"Want More Conversion Optimization Tips?\">    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only take one thing with you from reading this article, let it be this: <strong>there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cbad\u201d e-commerce survey score<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, you want your customers to be ecstatic all the time, so high scores are the ultimate goal.

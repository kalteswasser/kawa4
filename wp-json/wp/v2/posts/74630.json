micro-segmentation, can give your open rates a big lift.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people just can\u2019t resist checking out an email that\u2019s tailored specifically to them.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s really interesting is that personalized emails can actually deliver <a

various segments of your audience.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\"><strong>3. Get Your Timing Right<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how many marketers are super diligent about posting social media content at the perfect time?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How finding \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d is integral to getting their content featured in their followers\u2019 feeds?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How there are multiple software platforms that are solely devoted to scheduling posts?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a concept that\u2019s equally important for email marketing.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can nail the timing aspect and send out messages when your subscribers are most likely to check their email, it should have a positive impact on your open rates.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just put yourself in your average subscriber\u2019s shoes for a second.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you more likely to open an email that was recently sent and located at the top of your inbox or one that\u2019s been sitting there for hours and located at the bottom?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would venture to say that it would be the former and not the latter.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is definitely something to keep in mind.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to timing, there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every single brand.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fortunately, there is some concrete <a

considering that most people are punching out of work in the late afternoon and heading home.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line here is that your best bet is to send emails on the weekdays
